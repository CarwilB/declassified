2. AS PUBLISHED IN PRESENCIA (DAILY) OF AUGUST 9, PARAGRAPH 14 OF

DECISIONS ISSUED BY THE COMMISSION OF THE SAME AND, ESPECIALLY,

 122147Z


AND ON TRADEMARKS, PATENTS, LICENSES AND ROYALTIES.




                    

                   

"AT THE SAME TIME, THEY EXPRESS THEIR CONCERN ABOUT PROVISIONS
CONTAINED IN DECREE LAW NO 600 ISSUED BY THE CHILEAN GOVERNMENT
WHICH CREATES IN THAT COUNTRY A FOREIGN INVESTMENT STATUTE WHICH
THEY CONSIDER THREATENS (VULNURA) THE COMMITMENT ASSUMED BY THE
MEMBER COUNTRIES OF THE CARTAGENA AGREEMENT UNDER DECISION NO. 24,
WEAKENING THE JURIDICIAL STRUCTURE OF SAID AGREEMENT.
"THEY AGREE TO PROCEED BY COMMON AGREEMENT AND AS NECESSARY TO
MAINTAIN THE SPIRIT AND THE LETTER OF THE COMMITMENTS ASSUMED IN
THE MATTER."


3. PRESENCIA (AUGUST 9) SEPARATELY REPORTED THAT BARANDIARAN
STATED THAT A) MATTER WOULD BE DEBATED BY ANDEAN COMMISSION WHICH
WOULD MEET IN FIRST HALF OF SEPTEMBER, B) CHILEAN GOVERNMENT PRACTI-
CALLY HAS IGNORED SIGNED COMMITTMENT WITH SUBREGION, C) CHILE
GUARANTEEING FOREIGN INVESTMENT RATHER THAN REQUIRING GRADUAL
NATIONALIZATION AS PROVIDED BY DECISION 24, D) DECISION 24 NOW
BEING ACCEPTED BY INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL AND BRAZIL HAD ADOPTED
SIMILAR PROVISIONS AND E) CHILEAN ACTION CREATES RISKS THAT ANDEAN
PACT MEMBER CAN TAKE UNILATERAL ACTIONS THAT MIGHT DAMAGE ANDEAN
PACT AND THAT PACT MAY ENTER RUINOUS COMPETITION TO ATTRACT FOREIGN
INVESTMENT.


4. PRESENCIA REPORTED THAT TECHNICAL SECRETARY FOR INTEGRATION
JORGE GUTIERREZ REFUSED TO MAKE STATEMENT BUT THAT "SOURCES LINKED
TO INTEGRATION ACTIVITY" BELIEVED ANDEAN PACT TO BE THREATENED BY
ONE OF ITS MEMBERS FOR FIRST TIME IN FIVE YEARS, DEPLORED CHILEAN
MEASURE AND THAT NON-ADHERENCE TO DECISION 24 WOULD REMOVE PRO-
TECTION AGAINST ECONOMIC INFLUENCE OF POWERFUL INTERNATIONAL FINAN-
CIAL ENTITIES SUCH AS MULTINATIONAL FIRMS. ROLANDO PEREIRA, INTEGRATION


EXPBRT OF CHAMBER OF INDUSTRY, CAUTIONED THAT CHILEAN LAW SHOULD BE
"STUDIED CAREFULLY" BEFORE RAISING SUBJECT IN ANDIEAN COMMISSION.


5. AT DINNER PARTY GOB MINISTER INDUSTRY, COMMERCE & TOURISM AYAROA
WITHOUT ELABORATION INDICATED THAT HE INDEED SUPPORTS ADHERENCE TO
DECISION 24 AND CRITICIZES CHILEAN DECREE LAW 600. EX-GOB MINISTE OF
INDUSTRY, COMMERCE & TOURISM HECTOR ORMACHEA ALSO PRESENT, SAID IN
AYAROA'S PRESENCE THAT CLOSE ADHERENCE TO DECISION 24 WAS MISTAKE AND
THAT WHEN HE WAS MINISTER HE HAD DRAFTED BOLIVIA'S EXISTING INDUSTRIAL








 122147Z


INVESTMENT LAW THAT WAS AS LIBERAL AS CHILEAN MEASURE.


6. COMMENT. MISSION BELIEVES THAT GOB CONTINUES HAVE AMBIGUOUS POSI-
TION ON DECISION 24. GOB, GENERALLY, WISHES APPEAR IN SUPPORT DECI-
SION 24, MAINLY BECUASE IT IS SEEN AS QUID PRO/QUO FOR METAL MECHANIC


AND OTHER PROSPECTIVE INDUSTRY SECTOR ASSIGNMENTS THAT GOB BELIEVES
ARE NECESSARY TO INDUCE SOME INDUSTRIAL INVESTMENT TO BOLIVIA WHICH




                   

                  

OTHERWISE MIGHT NOT RECEIVE IT DUE TO REMOTENESS AND CHECKERED HISTORY


OF NATIONALIZATIONS. APPARENTLY MANY ELEMENTS GOB ALSO SUPPORT DECISION


24 AS GUARD AGAINST POWERFUL FOREIGN FIRMS AND AS EXCELLENT BASEFOR
NEGOTIATING TERMS OF ENTRY FOR FOREIGN INVESTMENT. ON OTHER HAND,
OTHER GOB AND PRIVATE SECTOR ELEMENTS VIEW DECISION 24 AS TOO RES-
TRICTIVE FOR BOLIVIA.


7. GOB ADOPTED DECISION 24 AS DOMESTIC LAW IN JULY 1974 DURING TORRES
REGIME. THAT ACT HAS NEVER BEEN GIVEN PRACTICAL EFFECT SINCE, DESPITE
REQUENT EFFORTS BY TECHNICIANS TO DRAFT REGULATIONS, BANZER GOVERN-
MENT HAS NEVERBEEN ABLE TO RESOLVE OWN
AMBIGUITY. WE UNDERSTAND THAT GO'S INVESTMENT INSTITUTE (INI)
HAS BEEN WORKING ON REGULATION OF DECISION 24 AND MODIFICATION OF
1972 BOLIVIAN INVESTMENT LAW. INI OFFICIAL TOLD EMBOFF LAST WEEK
THAT DRAFT REGULATIONS, WHICH WRITTEN IN SPIRIT OF DECISION 24
BUT BROADLY INTERPRETING CERTAIN SECTIONS, HAVE BEEN COMPLETED.
HE ADDED THAT DRAFT NOT RPT NOT NOW BEING CIRCULATED BECAUSE OF
UNCERTAINTIES CAUSED BY DEBATE OVER NEW CHILEAN INVESTMENT LAW.


8. RE ORMACHEA'S COMMENT (PARA 5 ABOVE) AND STATEMENT IN CHILEAN
PRESS RE BOLIVIAN LAW (SANTIAGO 4779, GOB RECOGNIZES POSSIBLE
CONFLECT BETWEEN ITS INVESTMENT LAW AND DECISION 24, BUT IN LAST
YEAR AT LEAST HAS TAKEN CONSISTENT POSITION THAT FOREIGN INVESTORS
MUST CONFORN WITH STRICTER ANDEAN CODE IF THEY WISH TO TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF ANDEAN MARKET.
