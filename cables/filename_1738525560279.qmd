2. **Introduction:** Since August, there have been several changes in Bolivia's political/military environment which bear on our security assistance relationship. First, the Government of Air Force General Juan Pereda proved to be short-lived: it was deposed on November 24, 1978, by a military junta headed by Army General David Padilla. The Padilla government promptly declared general elections for July 1, 1979, setting August 6 as the date of transferring power to the new constitutional government. Second, the economy, which began to decline toward the end of the Banzer regime, has, under Pereda and Padilla, deteriorated exponentially. Padilla has been reluctant to implement necessary corrective measures for two reasons: (1) he fears that attendant social unrest could threaten the electoral timetable, and (2) he does not want to invite popular criticism of the armed forces. Despite the deepening economic crisis, Padilla and his colleagues have been careful not to sacrifice their institutional interests. Aware that funds are in ever shorter supply, they are determined to purchase necessary military equipment before surrendering power on August 6. In our view, at least some of these purchases, although hardly timely, may be necessary. In the past several years, Bolivia's armed forces have been undersupplied and underequipped. Withdrawing from the government, they will require new equipment in order to recoup the professional esprit that has atrophied in recent years. Finally, although the threat of conflict between Chile and Peru has diminished, top commanders still worry that Bolivia's borders can be violated with impunity. This perception impels them to refurbish their inventories. Justified or not, they are not likely to feel secure until they have done so.

3. **US Interests/Objectives:**
A. The security assistance program is directly tied to the pivotal United States' interest of maintaining stability in the Andean region. In addition, the program helps develop interpersonal relationships between US and Bolivian officers. Such relationships facilitate valuable exchanges of views and serve as a conduit for expressions of US interest in matters such as democratization, respect for human rights, arms control and the reduction of tension in the Andean region. Finally, security assistance complements programs in support of economic development and helps sustain an environment in which the US has access to domestic raw materials and in which US products may be marketed competitively.
B. Security assistance objectives are postulated on the maintenance of a constructive relationship with the Bolivian military. They entail encouraging the military: (1) to display restraint and moderation in its renovation efforts; (2) to continue to emphasize its nation-building and civic action roles; and (3) to respect human rights and the democratic development process. Within this context, we must remain responsive to requests for assistance in acquiring reasonable amounts of military equipment and be able to provide appropriate CZ and CONUS training for armed forces personnel.

4. **External/Internal Threats:** The likelihood of conflict between Chile and Argentina over the Beagle Channel issue appears to have diminished significantly in the past few months; similarly, nearly halfway through the centenary year of the War of the Pacific, a Peruvian attack against Chile seems most improbable. Nonetheless, the specter of such conflicts, however unlikely, has made a strong impression on the Bolivian military. Whatever strategies the potential combatants may consider, Bolivian officers view their national boundaries as all but defenseless. They are acutely aware that since gaining independence in 1825, Bolivia has lost territory to all five neighboring countries. With a land area approximately twice that of France and with a population of less than five million, they need not resort to sophisticated analysis to demonstrate that it remains vulnerable to armed incursion and cultural encroachment.
