# DEPARTMENT OF STATE TELEGRAM
**UNCLASSIFIED**

1. I CALLED ON PRESIDENT BANZER MAY 13 AT MY INITIATIVE TO REVIEW
BILATERAL MATTERS PRIOR TO MY DEPARTURE FOR WASHINGTON. I TOLD THE
PRESIDENT THAT OVER THE WEEKEND THE RECONSTRUCTION ASSESSMENT TEAM
HAD DEPARTED AND THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE TEAM TO ASSESS
ALTERNATE CROPS TO SUBSTITUTE FOR COCA HAD ARRIVED. I NOTED THAT
AID WAS PREPARING AS EXPEDITIOUSLY AS POSSIBLE NEW LOANS IN THE
AGRICULTURAL AREA, EDUCATION, AND FOR RURAL ELECTRIFICATION. I
ALSO REPORTED THAT SEVERAL PIECES OF MILITARY EQUIPMENT HAD
REACHED PERUVIAN PORTS IN RECENT DAYS AND THAT THE MILGP WAS IN
THE PROCESS OF EXPEDITING ONWARD SHIPMENT TO LA PAZ.


2. PRESIDENT BANZER SAID THAT THE MOST URGENT NEED FOR
EXTERNAL ASSISTANCE FROM THE LENDING AGENCIES WAS FOR REHABILITATION
OF THE NATION'S RAILROADS AND ROADS AND THE CONSTRUCTION OF DEFENSES
AGAINST FUTURE FLOOD DAMAGE. HE SAID HE HOPED THAT THE REPORT
OF THE RECONSTRUCTION ASSESSMENT TEAM WOULD BE FOLLOWED PROMPTLY
BY FINANCING FROM WASHINGTON AGENCIES. HE URGED THAT CONSIDERA-
TION BE GIVEN TO A LOAN THROUGH THE EXISTING PADES MECHANISM FOR




 141613Z


A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE RECONSTRUCTION WORK. HE SAID THAT THE
PADES MECHANISM EXISTS, FUNCTIONS WELL, AND COULD EASILY ABSORB




                      

                  

ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR PUBLIC WORKS PROJECTS BUT THAT GOVERNMENT
REVENUES WERE NOT AVAILABLE FOR THIS PURPOSE


3. PRESIDENT BANZER SAID THE NEXT MOST URGENT NEED IN EXTERNAL
LENDINGWAS FOR COCA CROP SUBSTITUTION. FOLLOWING IN THE ORDER
OF TIMING IN HIS JUDGMENT WERE THE LONG-TERM DEVELOPMENT LOANS
OF AID. HE DEMONSTRATED FAMILIARITY WITH THE NEW LANDS LOAN AND
SOME INFORMATION ON THE RURAL ELECTRIFICATION AND EDUCATION
PROJECTS.


4. THE PRESIDENT EXPRESSED PLEASURE THAT MAP GRANT MILITARY
EQUIPMENT WAS ARRIVING AND ASKED ME IF I WOULD HELP BOLIVIA OBTAIN
C-130 TRANSPORT AIRCRAFT. HE SAID WHILE IT IS DESIRABLE TO HAVE
TWO AIRCRAFT, NATURALLY THE COUNTRY WOULD BE SATISFIED TO START
OFF WITH ONE. HE ADDED THAT WHILE IT WAS DESIRABLE TO HAVE NEW
C-130'S, IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE UNITS ARRIVE PROMPTLY, SO THAT
HE WOULD APPRECIATE OFFERS OF USED C-130'S IN GOOD
CONDITION. HE SAID THAT IT WAS HIS HOPE THAT THE $4 MILLION FMS
CREDIT WHICH HE HAS AUTHORIZED BOLIVIAN AUTHORITIES TO ACCEPT
COULD BE CONSIDERED AS THE FIRST PAYMENT TOWARD ONE OR TWO USED
C-130'S.


5. PRESIDENT BANZER ASKED ME TO EXPRESS TO US AUTHORITIES HIS
BELIEF THAT THE ECONOMIC SITUATION IS IMPROVING BUT THAT THE
NEEDS IN A COUNTRY IN THE LOW STATE OF DEVELOPMENT AS BOLIVIA ARE
ENORMOUS. THUS HE WELCOMES CONTINUED RESOURCES FOR DEVELOPMENT
ACTIVITIES IN BOLIVIA. HE SAID THAT POLITICALLY THE COUNTRY WAS
TRANQUIL AND THE SITUATION STABLE. HE SAID THAT HE ANTICIPATES
MAKING NO CHANGES IN THE CABINET WHICH HAS PROVEN ITSELF TO BE
COMPETENT AND TECHNICALLY WELL QUALIFIED. HE WILL BRING IN
REPRESENTATIVES OF THE SMALLER POLITICAL PARTIES BUT NOT AT THE
CABINET LEVEL, PROBABLY BRINGING THEM INTO SUB-CABINET POSITIONS
IN MINISTRIES AND PUBLIC SECTOR AGENCIES.


6. PRESIDENT BANZER WAS SUFFERING FROM A HEAVY COLD AND LOOKED
TIRED AND RUNDOWN. HOWEVER, HIS MOOD WAS CONFIDENT AND, AS
USUAL HE WAS VERY FRIENDLY.
STEDMAN
