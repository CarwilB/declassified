# DEPARTMENT OF STATE TELEGRAM
**UNCLASSIFIED**

1. BOLIVIAN NATIONAL AIRLINE, LLOYD AEREA BOLIVIANA (LAB),
FINALLY SIGNED SALES CONTRACT MAY 7 FOR PURCHASE 727-100 C FROM
TIA. LAB HAS ANNOUNCED THAT NEW AIRCRAFT WILL ARRIVE BOLIVIA
MAY 17 AND THAT AIRLINE'S SOLE OTHER JET WILL BE REMOVED FROM
SERVICE FOR OVERHAUL BY AVIANCA IN MID-JUNE.


2. CONTRACT SIGNING COMES AFTER OVER SIX MONTHS OF NEGO-
TIATIONS THAT WERE SLOWED BY INEXPERIENCED NEGOTIATORS AND
BICKERING AMONG BOLIVIANS. LAB PAID $3.7 MILLION FOR AIRCRAFT
AND $.4 MILLION FOR SPARES. TIA RECEIVED CERTIFIED CHECK
FOR $1.1 MILLION AND 90-DAY IRREVOCABLE LETTER OF CREDIT
FOR $3 MILLION.


3. GOB HAS SEVERAL COMMERCIAL LOAN OFFERS FOR FUNDS TO COVER
LETTER OF CREDIT IN NEXT 90 DAYS. CONSIDERATION WAS GIVEN TO
APPLYING FOR CAF FINANCING WITH SOME PARTICIPATION BY U.S. EXIM.
BOLIVIAN OFFICIALS NOW APPARENTLY BELIEVE THAT SUCH SOFTER
FINANCING WOULD NOW BE DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN BECAUSE AIR-
CRAFT IS USED AND ALREADY PRUCHASED." MOREOVER, CAF BELIEVED

LAB MAY PURCHASE FOUR MORE F-27S FOR IN-COUNTRY ROUTES. OTHER
