# DEPARTMENT OF STATE TELEGRAM
**UNCLASSIFIED**

1. BEGIN SUMMARY: POLITICAL UNREST STIMULATED BY SEPARATE
ISSUES OF ECONOMIC AGREEMENTS WITH BRAZIL AND UNIVERSITY
SITUATION, REPORTED IN REFTELS, IS NOW BRINGING TOGETHER DIS-
PARATE ANTI-GOVERNMENT GROUPS AND MOVEMENTS IN RISING CAMPAIGN
OF AGITATION AGAINST BANZER REGIME. AMONG OPPOSITION ELEMENTS
WHO CONTRIBUTED TO INCREASED POLITICAL TENSION OF PAST FEW
DAYS ARE PRO-VALVERDE FLANGISTAS, LARGE NUMBER OF UNIVERSITY
STUDENTS, A GROUP OF JUNIOR AND MIDDLE-GRADE MILITARY OFFICERS,
SOME LABOR UNIONS AND VESTIGES OF PDC-PRA-MNRI POLITICAL ALLIANCE.
GOVERNMENT IS AWARE OF DANGER IT FACES, AS DEMONSTRATED BY
EMERGENCY MEETINGS OF PRESIDENT BANZER WITH MILITARY HIGH COMMAND
AND SECURITY OFFICIALS, AND IS PREPARING COUNTER-MEASURES TO
DEAL WITH SITUATION. END SUMMARY.








 312240Z


2. AS REPORTED IN REFTLS, POLITICAL TENSIONS HAVE BEEN




                      

                   

KEPT AT RELATIVELY HIGH LEVEL THROUGHOUT MAY BY SEPARATE
ISSUES OF ECONOMIC AGREEMNTS WITH BRAZIL AND SUBSEQUENT
DETERIORATION IN UNIVERSITY SITUATION. WITHIN PAST FEW DDAYS,
EMBASSY HAS GATHERED NEW INFORMATION INDICATING THAT CURRENTS
OF UNREST SYMBOLIZED BY THESE TWO ISSUES ARE NOW UNITING INTO
BROADER ANTI-GOVERNMENT CAMPAIGN OF AGITUATION. ONE KEY ELE-
MENT IN NEW SITUATION IS INCREASED ACTIVITY OF GROUP OF
YOUNGER MILITARY OFFICERS, AT JUNIOR AND MIDDLE GRADES, WHO
HAVE OFTEN BEEN REPORTED IN PAST TO ENGAGE IN LOW-LEVEL PLOTTING
AGAINST GOVERNMENT. THESE OFFICERS, WHO INCREASINGLY APPEAR
TO HAVE BEEN MAJOR PROVOCATIVE ELEMENT IN JANUARY DISTURBANCES
IN COCHABAMBA, ARE DEEPLY CONCERNED OVER ISSUE OF BOLIVIA'S
ECONOMIC "DEPENDENCY" ON BRAZIL AND MAY ALSO HAVE HELPED TO
STIMULATE RECENT STUDENT DISORDERS IN LA PAZ AND SUCRE. ON
EDUCATIONAL SCENE, ALL UNIVERSITY AND SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENTS
ARE CURRENTLY ON STRIKE IN LA PAZ AND SUCRE. IN LATTER CITY,
FOUR DAYS OF DEMONSTRATIONS HAVE LEFT ESTIMATED THIRTY STUDENTS
AND TEN POLICE INJURED: REPORTS OF MORE SERIOUS CASUALTIES AMONG
STUDENTS CANNOT BE CONFIRMED AT PRESENT. SUPPORT BY ALL AMJOR
LABOR UNIONS FOR STUDENT' DEMANDS IN PAST TWO WEEKS ALSO CREATES
IMPRESSION OF GROWING ALLIANCE OF OPPORTUNITY BETWEEN VARIOUS
OPPOSITION FORCES. IN FACE OF THIS SITUATION, FSB DECLARED
NATIONAL MOBILIZATION OF PARTY MEMBERS "IN ARMS" ON MAY 30, IN
ORDER TO OPPOSE ALLEGED SUBVERSIVE MOVMENT AIMED AT
GOVERNMENT'S OVERTHROW. ON SAME DAY, FOUR MEMBERS OF
FALANGE AND EX-COMMANDER OF MILITARY AVIATION SCHOOL
COL HUGO MUNOZ DEPARTED SANTA CRUZ INTO "VOLUNTARY EXILE"
ALL FIVE MEN HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED IN PAST WITH PRO-VALVERDE
FORCES IN SANTNTA CRUZ AREA. FINALLY, SPOKESMEN FOR PDC-PRA-
MNRI ALLIANCE CONTINUE TO ISSUE SHRILL COMMUNIQUES DENOUNCING
BANZER GOVERMENT FOR HAVING "ERASED LAST VESTIGES OF DEMONCRACY
IN BOLIVIA" BY ITS RECENT ARRESTS OF STUDENT LEADERS, LABOR
OFFICIALS AND POLITICIANS.


3. GOVERNMENT CONCERN OVER THIS GROWING THREAT TO POLITICAL
STABILITY WAS EVIDENCED DRAMATICALLY ON MAY 29 WHEN PRESIDENT
BANZER CUT SHORT VISIT TO COCHABAMBA IN ORDER TO RETURN TO
LA PAZ FOR POST-MIDNIGHT CONFERENCE WITH MILITARY HIGH COMMAND.
SUBSEQUENTLY, BANZER CONFERRED WITH MILITARY AND SECURITY
OFFICIALS THROUGHOUT DAY OF MAY 30 BEFORE DEPARTING THAT EVENING






 312240Z


FOR SANTA CRUZ. MINISTER OF INTERIOR HAS BEEN HIGHLY ACTIVE
IN PAST FEW DAYS, VISITING SCENE OF DISTURBANCES IN SUCRE AND
ISSUING FREQUENT DENOUNCEMENTS OF "SUBVERSIVE"ACTIVITY IN
STUDENT AND LABOR CIRCLES. VARIOUS GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS HAVE
CANCELLED THEIR PLANS TO TRAVEL OUTSIDE BOLIVIA OR TO INTERIOR
OF COUNTRY AS GOB PREPARES MEASURES TO DEAL WITH PRESENT SITUATION.


4. COMMENT. RELIABLE EMBASSY SOURCE INFORMS US THAT




                   

                   

BANZER RETURN FROM COCHABAMBA WAS DUE TO DISCOVERY OF
ASSASSINATION PLOT THERE, WHICH WAS TO SET OFF COUP LED
BY ONE OR TWO REGIMENTS, UNION STRIKES AND STUDENT DEMON-
STRATIONS. BANZER TOLD MILITARY LEADERS HE COULD UNDERSTAND
LEFT OR OPPOSITION PARTIES TRYING TO KILL HIM, BUT NOT
MEMBERS OF HIS OWN MILITARY INSTITUTION. SUBSEQUENTLY HE
TOLD THIS IN RESERVE TO FALANGE TOP LEADERSHIP AND DECISION
WAS TAKEN TO HAVE FALANGE COME OUT IN MOBILIZATION IN SUPPORT
OF BANZER, HOLDING MILITARY IN RESERVE FOR LATER CONTINGENCIES.
MNR NOT TRUSTED BECAUSE OF ALLEGED LINKS TO COUP PLOT OF
SILES, OTHER EXILED MNR LEADERS: GOB FEARED SOME IN-COUNTRY
MNR LEADERS MIGHT HAVE LINKS TO COUP PLOTTERS.


5. IN PLOT ARE SOME MILITARY OFFICEFS (UNKNOWN) WHOM IDENTITY
BANZER HIMSELF IS CURRENTLY HOPING TO DETERMINE. SUSPICIONS
EXIST THAT SOMEONE AT HIGH LEVEL IS PATRONIZING THESE OFFICERS,
SINCE IN BOLIVIA NO ONE ATTEMPTS A COUP UNLESS THERE IS
SOMEONE IN THE GOVERNMENT TO "HOLD OPEN THE DOOR" FOR HIM.
SOME FEELING THAT KEY SENIOR OFFICER RESPONSIBLE MAY BE
MENDIETA OR GENERAL ALVAREZ. SOME PROPAGANDA SHEETS REPORTEDLY
CIRCULATING IN ARMED FORCES CALLING FOR JUNIOR OFFICERS TO
ASSUME COMMAND. ALSO, THERE IS SUSPICION AMONG LOYAL ARMY
OFFICERS THAT NUMBER OF OFFICERS IN POLICE FORCES,
JUST BELOW SENIOR LEVEL, ARE INVOLVED IN THE COUP PLOTTING.
EVIDENCE OF PRIOR ORGANIZATION OUTSIDE BACKING ALO FOUND
AT SUCRE, WHERE SOME OF STUDENTS THROWING MOLOTOV COCKTAILS
AT POLICE WERE FOUND TOHAVE INSTRUCTION SHEETS ON HOW TO
MAKE THESE, HOW TO FORM BARRICADES, PROTECT SELVES AGAINST
TEAR GAS, ET.


6. BANZER ASKED THAT FSB, OTHER CIVILIAN SUPPORTERS OF REGIME
GIVE HIM"THREE OR FOUR DAYS" TO DISCOVER WHO IS INVOLVED
IN PLANNED COUP. CARLOS VALVERDE ALSO IS REPORTED TO BE






 312240Z


IN COUNTRY, AND IS VERY LIKELY INVOLVED IN WHATEVER IS
GOING ON.
