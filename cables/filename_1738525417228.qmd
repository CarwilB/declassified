# DEPARTMENT OF STATE TELEGRAM
**UNCLASSIFIED**

::: {.cable-meta}
:::


1. In lieu of a press conference or departure statement, we suggest a press release at the time of the Secretary's departure from La Paz Wednesday, October 24. We have used this technique before, e.g. for Under Secretary Newsom's visit, and found it gets excellent coverage from local press.
2. Needless to say, substance, e.g. on tin, will have to be adjusted in the course of the Secretary's visit, but we submit the following so the Secretary can consider the type of release we propose.
3. Begin draft press release

The American Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, accompanied by Mrs. Vance, departed early Wednesday morning, October 24, after spending three days in La Paz as head of his country's delegation to the General Assembly of the Organization of American States. In the course of his visit to Bolivia, the Secretary conferred with President Walter Guevara Arze and Minister of Foreign Affairs Gustavo Fernandez, who also hosted a dinner Sunday evening for Secretary Vance and Foreign Ministers of Andean Pact countries attending the OAS General Assembly.

The American Secretary of State also had the opportunity to talk to a number of foreign ministers attending the General Assembly to discuss matters of mutual interest.

The Secretary noted his great satisfaction at having had the opportunity to visit Bolivia for the first time and to get to know the leaders of its constitutional government. He also expressed his pleasure in meeting some of the leading figures of Bolivia's armed forces who had successfully overseen the transition to elected, civilian rule. The Secretary indicated that he, like Bolivia's other friends in the hemisphere, was impressed with the openness and viality of free political debate here and with the admirable respect for human rights in the current Bolivian scene.

The presence of the Foreign Ministers of the Americas in La Paz for the OAS Assembly was already, the Secretary felt, a reflection of the prestige Bolivia has gained. "Your return to constitutional rule has placed this country in the historical tide that is affecting the entire Andean Community and has lent enhanced political and moral force to its voice in many forums," he said.

The Secretary noted that he had "long desired this opportunity to visit Bolivia and to meet with those whose contributions to Bolivian life he had followed from afar. Americans know Bolivians as a proud people, he said, whose heritage goes back to one of the great civilizations of the past and whose efforts in the last century kindled the movement for independence in Latin America. The Secretary observed that Bolivia had just accomplished the essence of democracy through free elections, selecting its leaders according to its own constitutional process."

In his meeting with President Walter Guevara Arze, Secretary Vance assured him that the U.S. would fully meet its obligations under the International Tin Agreement and that disposals of surplus U.S. tin stocks will only be carried out in the closest coordination with your (the Bolivian) government, with those of other tin exporters and with the International Tin Council. Secretary Vance noted that any sales would be gradual, over at least a three-year period, to avoid disruption of the tin market.

Secretary Vance underlined U.S. support for a resolution of Bolivia's aspirations for access to the sea on a basis acceptable to the countries directly involved in the region.
