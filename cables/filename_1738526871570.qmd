1. DURING COURTESY CALL I MADE JULY 10 WITH MILGP COMDR
SHAHA ON GENERAL RENE BERNAL, NEW MINISTER OF DEFENSE, I
MENTIONED THAT I HAD HEARD THAT THE USSR HAD MADE OFFERS TO
BOLIVIA OF MILITARY EQUIPMENT. BERNAL SAID THAT MY INFORMATION
WAS CORRECT AND THAT HE HAD BEEN INVITED SEVERAL WEEKS AGO TO
MAKE A TRIP TO THE SOVIET UNION. IN ADDITIONA, THE SOVIET
AMBASSADOR HAD INVITED HIM TO THE SOVIET EMBASSY FOR A SOCIAL
FUNCTION AT WHICH A SOVIET MOVIE WAS SHOWN. BERNAL SAID THAT
HIS ATTENDNANCE AT THE MOVIE WAS THE MINIMUM DIPLOMATIC RESPONSE
HE COULD MAKE TO THE SOVIETS, AND HE HAD NO INTENTION OF
TRAVELING TO THE SOVIET UNION. HE SAID HE OPPOSED COMMUNISM
AND THE SOVIET SYSTEM AND LEFT ME WITH THE IMPRESSION THAT
HE HAD LITTLE INTEREST IN SOVIET EQUIPMENT.


2. THIS EXCHANGE FOLLOWED AN EXTREMELY FRIENDLY CONVERSATION
DURING WHICH BERNAL EXPRESSED AFFECTION, RESPECT, AND ADMIRA-
TION FOR THE U.S., ITS PEOPLE, ITS ACCOMPLISHMENTS, AND ITS
ROLE AS LEADER OF FREE WORLD.
STEDMAN
