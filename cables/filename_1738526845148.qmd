# DEPARTMENT OF STATE TELEGRAM
**UNCLASSIFIED**

1.  **Action requested:** Include Bolivia in the itinerary of the above textile mission. Though Bolivia does not have industry as large as Colombia, Venezuela, and Brazil, its industry is presently operating at close to 100 percent capacity with most companies carrying out and planning expansion. Therefore, we recommend the mission return from Brazil via La Paz.

2.  **Textile industry is as follows:**

    | Name of Firm                           | Employs | Manufactures                                            | Sales       |
    | :------------------------------------- | :------ | :------------------------------------------------------ | :---------- |
    | Manufacturas de Algodon, S.A.          | 1,016   | Textiles and cotton threads                             | 2,850,000   |
    | Lanificio Boliviano Domingo Soligno S.A.| 735     | Wool broad, woven fabrics, wool blankets, men suitings  | 1,500,000   |
    | Manufacturas Textiles Forno S.A.       | 490     | Cotton fabrics, woolen fabrics, blankets, acrylic fabrics| 1,000,000   |
    | Sociedad Nacional Textil S.A.          | 257     | Cotton yarns                                            | 770,000     |
    | Establecimientos Textiles Estatex S.A. | 169     | Nylon fabrics, rayon fabrics, polyester fabrics         | 1,200,000   |
    | Textiles Asociados S.A.                | 160     | Weaving synthetics fabrics                              | 650,000     |
    | Fabrica de Tejidos Jacquard Fateja S.A.| 109     | Cotton fabrics, fiber and silk textile fabrics, brocades| 800,000   |
    | Industrias Silesia                     | 72      | Men's hosiery, women's stockings, shirts                | 600,000     |
    | Textiles Orientales S.A.               | 110     | Cotton cloths, textile bags                             | 268,000     |
    | Combofla (Government wholly owned)     | 101     | Wool tops, fur clothing                                 | 200,000     |

    In addition, a group of Santa Cruz businessmen have formed a new firm (Hilados y Tejidos Santa Cruz, S.A.) to produce yarn. They estimate equipment purchase of $3.5 million. Part of the yarn output will be used to manufacture 3,000,000 bags yearly to store rice, sugar, corn, etc. A Medellin, Colombia firm (we have been unable to obtain name) was contracted to perform a feasibility study. We recommend that the Medellin local branch of Bank of America be contacted to obtain the company's name so that mission members can discuss the Santa Cruz project. The new Santa Cruz company is to sign a contract on May 10, with the Medellin company which will proceed with equipment purchases and final plant design. The Santa Cruz group is still interested in discussing equipment requirements.

    The Government of Bolivia (GOB) is planning a second yarn plant in Santa Cruz costing an unconfirmed US$15 million. This project is being financed under a US$25 million Bank of America loan to the GOB which presumably will relend to Corporacion Boliviana de Fomento (C.B.F.) which will arrange meetings for mission members with C.B.F.

3.  **Bolivia is an exporter of cotton.** Projected plants would process this raw material. The Santa Cruz area produces virtually all Bolivian cotton as follows:

    | Period    | Hectares# | (100 lbs. units) |
    | :-------- | :-------- | :--------------- |
    | 1952/53   | 200       | 572              |
    | 1958/59   | 1,000     | 15,000           |
    | 1968/69   | 6,000     | 90,000           |
    | 1969/70   | 8,500     | 120,000          |
    | 1970/71   | 17,600    | 228,000          |
    | 1971/72   | 47,000    | 335,000          |
    | 1972/73## | 60,000    | 900,000          |

    # 10,000 sq. meters per hectare.
    ## Estimated

    Note: The percentage increase of both hectares and output from the period 1968/69 to 1972/73 was 900 percent or a yearly average of 58.5 percent (compounded). Expansion is still in motion.

4.  **Statistics on the importation of textile machinery is not current.** The latest two years available reflect imports of:

    |        | Total (CIF) World | Total (CIF) USA# |
    | :----- | :---------------- | :--------------- |
    | 1970   | 833.1             | 490.1            |
    | 1971   | 745.9             | 530.6            |

    # US $(000)

5.  **Though the above figures are relatively low, our interviews with the La Paz companies listed in paragraph no. 2 indicate seven out of nine companies intend to expand their operations.** As production of cotton increases, new companies will be formed to process yarn, and as the present La Paz firms are operating at close to 100 percent, there will be an increase in the importation of textile machinery of several million US dollars.

6.  **All companies interviewed expressed interest in new textile technology.**

7.  **As most Bolivian textile engineers are European educated and equipment oriented, the mission would be in a position to develop US interests.**

8.  **All companies expressed interest in discussing their equipment requirements with mission members.**
