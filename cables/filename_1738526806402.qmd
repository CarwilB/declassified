# DEPARTMENT OF STATE TELEGRAM
**UNCLASSIFIED**

1. **Summary:** Request amendment of FY 1974 NCAP budget to include additional $15,000 for operating expenses.

2. The USG under a USAID-Bolivia PROAG paid a monthly bonus to members of the drafting committee of the Bolivian narcotics law for the four months it took that commission to complete its work. The law has been promulgated and it establishes the framework and provides the authorization for a Bolivian narcotics control entity capable of dealing with all aspects of the narcotics problem. However, until the GOB approves funding for this entity it will not come into being, which means that the only narcotics control activity in Bolivia for the remainder of FY 1974 will be that of Major Lopez' police unit against manufacturers and traffickers of cocaine.

3. The drafting commission of the law should continue in being, as the only nucleus of expertise on narcotics matters in Bolivia, in order to establish the basic working norms of the various components of the new entity; to travel to the departmental capitals of the country to conduct seminars on the law for local authorities; to act as the original management of the new entity, prepare its budget, select its staff, and generally get it into operation.

4. This essential activity was not foreseen in preparing the FY 1974 NCAP budget. The additional amount requested includes bonuses for seven officials plus one secretary (total of $5,000 for 5 months beginning February 1 through June 30), travel and per diem expense ($5,000), publicity and communications expense ($2,000), office equipment ($2,000), miscellaneous expenses ($1,000).

5. Approval of funds to keep the Bolivian members of the narcotics law drafting committee working together on the narcotics problem will maintain the momentum behind the narcotics effort and prevent progress to date from being dissipated through lack of attention. Committee head is Sub-Secretary of Justice Gaston Ledesma who is favorably known in Department.

6. Would appreciate early decision as group still standing by ready to carry out mission, but may begin to break up soon if lack of sufficient funds leaves it with nothing to do for next few months.
