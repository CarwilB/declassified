# DEPARTMENT OF STATE TELEGRAM
**UNCLASSIFIED**

1. ARA/BC OFFICE DIRECTOR KARKASHIAN, ACCOMPANIED BY DCM AND
EMBOFF, CALLED ON MIN IND/COM APRIL 23. CONVERSATION QUICKLY
SETTLED ON APPLEGATE-YOUNGQUIST LAND EXPROPRIATION DISPUTE.
MINISTER CALLED IN SEVEN HIGH-LEVEL MINISTRY OFFICIALS WHO ARE
DEALING WITH CASE, AND HOUR-LONG WIDE-RANGING CONVERSATION FOLLOWED.


2. ANTONIO TAPIA OF SUGAR INSTITUTE WAS PRINCIPAL SPOKESMAN AND
ARGUED THAT LEGAL CONTROVERSY INVOLVING BOLIVIAN LAW COULD NOT
BE SETTLE OUTSIDE BOLIVIA. THIS NORMAL PRACTICE AND IN PAST
INVESTMENT DISPUTES U.S. FIRMS OR THEIR REPRESENTATIVES HAD COME TO
BOLIVIA FOR NEGOTIATIONS. HE CONCLUDED THAT APPLEGATE, YOUNGQUIST
OR THEIR REPRESENTATIVE MUST COME TO BOLIVIA TO NEGOTIATE MATTER.
TAPIA NOTED THAT BOLIVIAN LAW PROVIDES THAT LAND EXPROPRIATIONS
COMPENSATED BY 25 YEAR 2 PERCENT BONDS BUT THAT "HIGHEST LEVELS"
OF GOB IN RECENT PAST HAD ORDERED THAT CASE BE SETTLE BY EX-
CEPTIONAL MEASURE OF OFFERING COMPENSATION IN LAND.


3. KARKASHIAN STATED THAT HE UNDERSTOOD TAPIA'S LEGAL POSITION
BUT THERE HAVE BEEN CONTRADICTORY STATEMENTS BY PARTIES THAT
LEFT GOB POSITION UNCLEAR AND CONFUSED RESOLUTION OF ISSUE. HE
URGED GOB TO SET DOWN DETAILS OF ITS CASE AND AS PRACTICAL AID






 261534Z


TO RESOLUTION OF ISSUES BE MORE SPECIFIC. FOR EXAMPLE, HE




                       

                  

SUGGESTED THAT GOB MAKE REQUESTS FOR SPECIFIED DOCUMENTS THAT IT
LACKS RATHER THAN DEMANDING APPLEGATE-YOUNGQUIST SUBMIT "ALL
DOCUMENTS." THE BOLIVIAN OFFICIALS VOICED GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH
SUCH AN APPROACH.


4. MINISTER NOTED THAT IMPORTANT FACTS IN CASE REMAIN TO BE DETER-
MINED BUT THIS CAN MOST APPROPRIATELY AND MOST EASILY BE DONE IN
BOLIVIA WHERE DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE AVAILABLE. HE SAID THAT GOB
FLEXIBLE AND READY TO NEGOTIATE SIZE AND LOCATION OF LAND FOR
COMPENSATION. HE REPEATED EARLIER STATEMENT THAT ONCE CASE
SETTLED, APPLEGATE AND YOUNGQUIST COULD SELL LAND FOR CASH.
HE CONCLUDED BY STATING THAT HE WAS CONFIDENT THAT WITH GOOD
WILL ON BOTH SIDES, CASE COULD BE CONCLUDED IN MONTH AND ONE HALF.


5. COMMENT: MEETING WAS CLEAR INDICATION THAT GOB READY TO
NEGOTIATE SETTLEMENT OF CASE IN GOOD FAITH, ALTHOUGH IT WILL INSIST
THAT NEGOTIATION TAKE PLACE IN BOLIVIA. ARGUMENT THAT THIS
PRESENTS HARDSHIP TO U.S. CLAIMANTS LESS PERSUASIVE SINCE
APPLEGATE HAS RETURNED TO BOLIVIA AND IS FARMING IN SANTA CRUZ
AREA.
