# DEPARTMENT OF STATE TELEGRAM
**UNCLASSIFIED**

1. IN VIEW OF RECENT INTELLIGENCE RECEIVED BY U.S. MISSION ON THIS
TOPIC, EMBASSY SUGGESTS SOME EDITORIAL CHANGES IN PARAGRAPHS 24 AND
25 OF SUBJECT PAPER DEALING WITH BOLIVIA.


2. REVISED TEXT WOULD READ AS FOLLOWS:
"PRESIDENT HUGO BANZER WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY TRY TO EXPLOIT
INCREASED TENSIONS BETWEEN PERU AND CHILE TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE
PACIFIC OCEAN, PROBABLY BY ENCOURAGING BOTH COUNTRIES TO VIEW BOLIVIA
AS A POTENTIAL BUFFER. ALTHOUGH BOLIVIAN RELATIONS WITH PERU HAVE
COOLED RECENTLY BECAUSE OF WHAT BOLIVIA PERCEIVES TO BE LEFTIST
INFLUENCE IN THE PERUVIAN MILITARY, MOST BOLIVIAN MILITARY LEADERS
TEND TO IDENTIFY WITH PERU MORE THAN CHILE BECAUSE OF ETHNIC AFFINITY,


COMMON HISTORICAL BACKGROUND, AND A COMMON AND DEEPLY ROOTED ANTIPATHY


TOWARD CHILE. HOWEVER, ALTHOUGH BOLIVIA HAS TRADITIONALLY VIEWED
CHILE AS AS ENEMY, THE TWO GOVERNMENTS ARE PRESENTLY ON BETTER
TERMS THAN AT ANY TIME SINCE THE 1962 BREAK IN DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS.
BRAZIL HAS ALSO BEEN ENCOURAGING AS BOLIVIAN-CHILEAN RAPPROACHMENT.

ON BALANCE, IT APPEARS THAT IN THE FACE OF IMMINENT OR ACTUAL




                        

                 

HOSTILITIES, BOLIVIA WOULD MOST LIKELY REMAIN UNCOMMITED DUE TO
A REALIZATION BY THE BANZER GOVERNMENT THAT POSSIBLE IMMEDIATE GAINS
OBTAINED THROUGH INTERVENTION WOULD BE MORE THAN OFFSET IN THE LONGER
TERMS BY DIFFICULTIES CAUSED BY BOLIVIA'S AFFECTED NEIGHBORS. IT SHOULD


BE NOTED, HOWEVER, THAT THE NEUTRAL STANCE OF THE BANZER REGIME COULD
CHANGE UNDER A DIFFERENT GOVERNMENT (CHANGES IN BOLIVIAN GOVERNMENTS
HAVE BEEN NOTORIOUSLY FREQUENT). IF BOLIVIA BELATEDLY SUPPORTED EITHER


SIDE, IT WOULD MOST LIKELY NOT BE WITH A MAJOR TROOP COMMITMENT, BUT
ANY SUPPORT IT RENDERED WOULD HAVE A PSYCHOLOGICAL AS WELL AS DIVER-
SIONARY EFFECT ON OPERATIONS AT THE FRONT."
