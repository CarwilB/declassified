# DEPARTMENT OF STATE TELEGRAM
**UNCLASSIFIED**

1. (LOU only where noted.)

I. **Country Perception of Illicit Narcotics Activities and its Control Efforts**

(LOU) As of 1978, Bolivia's perception of the narcotics problem might be described as maturing. Political leaders know that they have a problem, but in a year of electoral campaigns, fraud at the ballot box and military coups, there has not been the will on the part of the GOB to enforce key measures. Most glaring has been the failure to enforce the law which calls for the destruction of unregistered new plantings of coca. While we continue to urge action, there is no prospect that the present caretaker military government will do anything effective. We believe, however, that the chances of action from an elected government, scheduled to take over in August, are good. For 1978, and up to the present, political and other major concerns have overshadowed the drug problem in the minds of Bolivian leaders.
The broader spectrum of Bolivian business, social and educational leadership, with some exceptions has only begun to appreciate that cocaine is a menace to this society as well as to the US. Firm conviction that something must be done soon to protect Bolivian society is still lacking. Embassy believes, nevertheless, that awareness of the problem has heightened during the past three years.
On the positive side, the GOB with US help has considerably enhanced the capacity of the DNSP and Customs to take effective action against traffickers and cocaine processors. While this was not reflected in the very slight increase in seizures in 1978 (236 kilos of sulphate and HCL) as compared with 1977 (210 kilos of sulphate and HCL), there has been a notable increase during Jan.-Mar. 1979 (over 160 kilos of sulphate and HCL). The DNSP has also pushed ahead with the registration of coca merchants, transporters and retailers, and expects to open checkpoints at 25-50 locations along the coca farm-to-market routes. If effectively and honestly operated, these checkpoints, given Bolivia's limited road network, could prove a significant deterrent to uncontrolled, illegal coca shipments.
In short, the GOB does perceive coca and cocaine as a threat and the US does get cooperation. In 1978, however, due to an unfortunate mix of politics, corruption and inefficiencies, the GOB was not prepared to make the hard decisions needed for a full-scale crackdown on traffickers and illegal plantings. (End LOU.)

II. **US Interest**

In cooperation with the GOB, the US hopes to achieve (1) a reduction of coca production to the level of legal consumption (about 12,000 MT) and (2) a decrease in illegal exports of cocaine by a high percentage.

A. **Progress:** We cannot point to significant progress in 1978 in terms of either reduction of coca plantings or of seizures of cocaine. The indications are, in fact, that plantings increased and, while we have no reliable estimates, it is likely that illicit cocaine exports also increased in 1978.
Definite progress can be reported, however, in studies, research and data-gathering essential to a successful crop diversification/coca reduction program. Under the "Agricultural Development in Coca Zones" project, the Felt-Needs Study, aerial photography of the coca areas, the "Multidisciplinary Study" and the coffee productivity and sanitation campaign in the Yungas were completed. Construction of the La Jota Experimental Station in the Chapare has progressed substantially and the cacao productivity and sanitation campaign is well under way.
Regarding enforcement, the most significant step forward was the beginning in October of the DNSP program, assisted and supported by the Mission, to register and license all dealers and merchants and coca. Scheduled for completion in March 1979, the registration will open the way for greatly improved controls on coca movements and marketing. (Peruvian narcotics authorities visiting Bolivia in December were highly impressed with this initiative.) In addition, DNSP territorial coverage and communications were improved as well as detector dog capabilities. The DNSP, with its own US-trained officers, conducted its first in-country narcotics training course.
The Embassy also completed an extensive narcotics strategy paper, with a reassessment of our programs and a proposal for the establishment of a GOB coca marketing board, an "Estanco". The board, by purchasing and marketing all or most of the Bolivian coca crops, would assure an adequate supply of coca at reasonable prices for legal users (chewers primarily) while the overall crop is reduced as a result of crop diversification and enforcement programs.
