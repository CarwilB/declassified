# DEPARTMENT OF STATE TELEGRAM
**UNCLASSIFIED**

1. EXILED MNR POLITICIAN CIRO HUMBOLDT MADE A DRAMATIC
RETURN TO BOLIVIAN POLITICAL LIFE ON AUGUST 28, HOLDING A
SURPRISE PRESS CONFERENCE IN THE OFFICES OF THE MNR IN
DOWNTOWN LA PAZ. HUMBOLDT REPORTEDLY TELEPHONED THE LOCAL
NEWSPAPERS, PRETENDING TO BE MNR EXECUTIVE SECRETARY RUBEN
JULIO, AND ANNOUNCED THAT "IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENTS" WOULD BE
ANNOUNCED AT MNR HEADQUARTERS. HUMBOLDT HIMSELF THEN STEPPED
OUT OF A TAXI IN FRONT OF THE MNR BUILDING AT PRECISELY
4 P.M., WEARING A BEARD AND DRESSED IN A HAT AND DARK
CLOTHES, AND ENTERED TO READ A STATEMENT TO THE PRESS.


2. HUMBOLDT'S STATEMENT AND SUBSEQUENT COMMENTS TO NEWSMEN
ARE LARGELY A DEFENSE OF HIS OWN ACTIONS FROM 1971 TO THE
PRESENT. CLAIMING THAT HIS ENEMIES USED THE JUNE 5 COUP
ATTEMPT AS A PRETEXT TO REMOVE HIM FROM THE SCENE,
HUMBOLDT ASKED THAT THE PROOFS OF HIS INVOLVEMENT IN THE
YOUNG OFFICERS' REVOLT BE MADE PUBLIC. AT THE SAME TIME,
HUMBOLDT REITERATED HIS CLAIM TO BE THE ACTING NATIONAL
CHIEF OF THE MNR; HE DESCRIBED DR. VICTOR PAZ ESTENSSORO
AS THE TRUE CHIEF OF THE PARTY AND ADMITTED TO HAVING MET
WITH PAZ IN LIMA PRIOR TO HIS OWN CLANDESTINE RETURN TO
BOLIVIA. FOLLOWING THE PRESS CONFERENCE, HUMBOLDT LEFT






 292229Z


MNR HEADQUARTERS AND DEPARTED AS HE HAD COME, IN A TAXI.




                      

                   


3. GOVERNMENT AND OFFICIAL MNR REACTION TO HUMBOLDT'S
SUDDEN RE-APPEARANCE WERE NOT LONG IN COMING. A MINISTRY OF
INTERIOR COMMUNIQUE ANNOUNCED THAT THE MINISTRY WOULD DETAIN
HUMBOLDT FOR HAVING ENTERED THE COUNTRY ILLEGALLY.
THE COMMUNIQUE ALSO ACCUSED HIM OF HAVING RETURNED SOLELY
TO PROMOTE HIS OWN PERSONAL INTERESTS WITHIN THE MNR.
ACTING MNR CHIEF GUILLERMO FORTUN AND OTHER HIGH PARTY
OFFICIALS ALSO CRITICIZED HUMBOLDT'S ACTION IN RETURNING
TO BOLIVIA. IN A BRIEF COMMUNIQUE, THE MNR HIGH COMMAND
AGAIN ACCUSED HUMBOLDT OF INVOLVEMENT IN THE JUNE 5 COUP
ATTEMPT, AND CHARGED THAT HE HAD VOLUNTARILY ABANDONED HIS
POST AS ACTING PARTY CHIEF TO ATTEMPT THE OVERTHROW OF THE
BANZER GOVERNMENT.


4. THE EMBASSY HAS BEEN INFORMED THAT HUMBOLDT WAS TAKEN
INTO CUSTODY BY OFFICIALS OF THE MINISTRY OF INTERIOR ON THE
MORNING OF AUGUST 29.


5. COMMENT: SPECULATION IS RUNNING HIGH AS TO THE MOTIVES
FOR HUMBOLDT'S BRIEF BUT SPECTACULAR RE-EMERGENCE ON THE
BOLIVIAN POLITICAL SCENE. ONE POSSIBILITY, WHICH SEEMS
UNLIKELY IN OUR VIEW, IS THAT HUMBOLDT RETURNED TO LEAD OR
TAKE PART IN A NEW CONSPIRACY AGAINST THE BANZER GOVERNMENT.
ANOTHER, MORE LIKELY, EVENTUALITY IS THAT HUMBOLDT SET
OUT ON HIS RETURN TRIP TO BOLIVIA WITH THE INTENTION OF MAKING
A SURPRISE APPEARANCE AT THE MNR CONVENTION, ORIGINALLY
SCHEDULED TO BEGIN ON AUGUST 28. HOWEVER, WHEN HE ARRIVED
IN BOLIVIA AND DISCOVERED THAT THE CONVENTION HAD BEEN
POSTPONED AT THE LAST MOMENT, TO SEPTEMBER 27, HE DECIDED
TO STAGE A PUBLIC RE-APPEARANCE AS THE BEST WAY OF SAVING
THE SITUATION. A RELATED CONSIDERATION IS THE POSSIBILITY
OF A PAZ-HUMBOLDT UNDERSTANDING IN LIMA, WHERE-BY HUMBOLDT
AGREED TO MAKE HIS CLANDESTINE RETURN TO BOLIVIA AS
PART OF APLAN TO FURTHER WEAKEN THE POSITION OF GUILLERMO
FORTUN. FORTUN HAS APPEARED, IN RECENT WEEKS, TO BE
INCREASINGLY OUT OF FAVOR WITH BOTH THE BANZER GOVERNMENT
AND A MAJORITY OF THE MNR'S MILITANTS. WHATEVER THE LONG-TERM
EFFECTS OF HUMBOLDT'S RETURN, HE IS LIKELY NOW TO BE
QUICKLY BUNDLED OFF INTO PRISON OR EXILE BY GOB SECURITY






 292229Z


OFFICIALS, WHO ARE PRESUMABLY EMBARRASSED BY THE THEATRICAL
MANNER IN WHICH THE FORMER MNR LEADER MADE KNOWN HIS
RENEWED PRESENCE IN BOLIVIA.
PARKER
