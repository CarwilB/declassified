# DEPARTMENT OF STATE TELEGRAM
**UNCLASSIFIED**

5. I told the President that subsequent to his observations to Congressman Whalen about our military assistance program, I had made an investigation with our MILGP to determine the causes and remedies for the delays in the delivery of military equipment. I noted that I have presented new recommendations to Washington for expediting certain equipment for the Bolivian Tipos. As to economic assistance, I noted the continuous and comprehensive efforts of our AID mission to work in the agricultural, public health and education fields, giving me every confidence of a sustained and effective economic cooperation program with his government. I told him I could not understand where his representatives in Washington could have obtained views that our government felt he would soon fall. I indicated our policy was unchanged and it was one of continued support for the GOB and its effort to bring progress and development to the country. I asked for guidance as to which Bolivian authorities the US Mission should work with in attempting to devise a more concrete project for agricultural assistance along the lines he had suggested. I attempted to probe as to whether he thought he had a financial problem or a supply problem. His response was most general and indicated that he had needs both financial and equipment. As I departed Presidential Palace, I met Brazilian Ambassador entering, who, I had been informed informally, was being summoned also for requests for assistance.

6. **Comment:** While there may be elements of fact in the synthesis of international concentration of extremists on Bolivia, I have been told that the Zenteno story has not been confirmed and that much of the difficulty in the Cochabamba area is home grown. I agree with his lament about our inability to have kept up the rhythm of deliveries of military equipment for the Tipos. I believe also that the style and pace of our AID economic assistance programs is appropriate and well focused. However, given our continued policy to attempt to support this President and his administration, I do intend to search with the help of our AID and economic people for some ways to assist in the agricultural area, possibly through the device of re-programming counterpart, local currency accumulations and the use of ongoing project activities.

7. I would appreciate prompt reaction from State and Defense as to ways and means in which we might meet the request for expedited action on MAP equipment submitted in La Paz telegram 608. It would go a long way, I believe, to helping the psychological mood here and to meeting our foreign policy objectives. If State/AID have any suggestions with regard to the requests for emergency economic assistance, I would of course be delighted to have them as promptly as possible. It would also be of interest to me if there is any way of ascertaining the basis for the report that Bolivian representatives in Washington are informing President Banzer that USG has reached the conclusion that he is soon to fall.
