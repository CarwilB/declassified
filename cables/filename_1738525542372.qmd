# DEPARTMENT OF STATE TELEGRAM
**UNCLASSIFIED**

2. **Summary:** According to the local IMF representative, Jorge Sol Perez, the Bolivian reserve situation is now extremely critical but with luck the country can survive through December. In 1980, however, Bolivia's debt service burden will be unsustainable without stabilization measures. The GOB is now studying the IMF proposed stabilization program and is likely to make some counterproposals, some of which Sol Perez has not yet communicated to the IMF headquarters in Washington. The GOB opposes a managed float preferring instead a one-step devaluation with a dual exchange system to lessen the social impact. The GOB realizes that the IMF will be reluctant to support such a plan with Extended Fund Facility (EFF) financing. Sol Perez expects the GOB to request the US to persuade the IMF to accept its proposals. (Note: Sol Perez has acquired this information through informal discussions with GOB officials and he enjoined us in the strongest terms from revealing to others--especially IMF headquarters or the GOB--that we are aware of it.) End Summary.

Bolivia's Debt Service Burden

3. The GOB had obligations to repay $142.2 million in short-term loans to foreign central banks and commercial banks between July 1979 and January 1980. (These credits from central banks are not really swaps but rather time deposits at rates of interest ranging from 9.9 to over 11 percent.) The GOB has repaid $10.7 million of these obligations recently. The remaining $131.5 were refinanced for six months and therefore are due between January 1980 and July 1980.

4. In addition, on the way back from the NAM meeting, GOB Foreign Minister Fernandez stopped in Caracas and obtained $43 million more from Venezuela. The GOB has drawn $20 million of this and has $23 million more at its disposal. The terms are six months at 15 percent. GOB also line up $10 million from the Andean Fund (CAF) for three months at 15 percent and has drawn this down. At the Belgrade IMF/IBRD Annual Meeting (or more likely, the Latin American preparatory meeting in Madrid), the GOB obtained a $20 million line of credit from Spain, presumably also for six months, which it has not yet drawn.

5. Therefore, the GOB has obligations to repay $161.5 million in short-term debts during the first half of 1980. Moreover, if it draws the additional $23 million from Venezuela and $20 million from Spain before the end of 1979, the total principal to repay by mid-1980 will be $204.5 million. Venezuela has the greatest exposure--about $83 million of these short-term obligations. Deutsch Sudamerikanish Bank has about $39 million and Bankers Trust about $10 million.

6. According to Sol Perez, Bolivia's contracted medium and long-term public debt with foreign commercial banks totals $500 million.

7. Payments on Bolivia's total medium and long-term public foreign debt (with public and private creditors) will amount to $301 million in principal, interest and commissions during 1980. Payments to foreign commercial banks comprise one-half, or $150 million, of this. Thus, total debt service payments in 1980 are likely to total more than $462.5 million--$161.5 in principal on short-term obligations to central banks (interest will be additional) and $301.0 million for medium and long-term debt-- and could exceed $500 million.

8. The IMF estimates that $462 million represents 51 percent of Bolivia's projected exports (FOB) in 1980. Since Bolivia's receipts for non-factor services are minimal, this will give Bolivia a debt service ratio in 1980 of approximately 50 percent.

Bolivia's Reserve Position

9. The Central Bank's gross reserves are now about $150 million. Of this $40-50 million is in non-liquid assets--mostly gold. The $110-100 million remaining consists entirely of "depositores de terceros," i.e., deposits of state enterprises, and reserve deposits of commercial banks. According to Sol Perez, the Central Bank is playing a dangerous game because the possible combination of large withdrawals by state enterprises (COMIBOL, YPFB or ENAF) plus an increase in purchases of foreign exchange by the Bolivian public could consume this $100-110 million rapidly and force the Central Bank to institute foreign exchange controls or halt sales altogether.

10. Sol Perez believes the GOB can survive until the end of December (if all goes well) because the 500 percent prior-deposit decree has reduced average net daily foreign exchange losses from about $3 million to $1.5 million. Therefore, losses for November and December are likely to total about $90 million. The Central Bank should be able to sustain this with the $43 million in unused credit from Venezuela and Spain and the $50 million in unused lines from New York commercial banks.

Status of GOB-IMF Negotiations

11. As reported previously, the IMF's proposed package for Bolivia comprises several basic measures:
(a) Increase hydrocarbon prices by 130 percent;
(b) Rationalize the GOB investment budget;
(c) Refinance foreign commercial debt and limit new foreign borrowing (the IMF has recommended refinancing at this time only $230 million. The remaining $270 million could be refinanced, if necessary, in 1982 or 1983 when interest rates might be lower than at present.);
(d) Adjust taxation of the mining sector to encourage increased investment;
(e) Rationalize monetary instruments (e.g., increase interest rates on savings from current 10 percent, dedollarization of savings accounts, rational GOB credit policy);
(f) Adopt a moderate wage policy;
(g) Devalue the peso by means of a managed float.

12. From conversations with GOB officials over the last two weeks, Sol Perez has pieced together what he believes is the course of action the GOB seems most likely to take in response to the IMF recommendations. Sol has not yet shared these tentative conclusions with IMF headquarters, so they should be held very closely. Sol Perez believes the GOB could well come up with a proposal along the following lines by mid-November:
(a) The GOB will increase hydrocarbon prices by 130 percent as recommended by the Fund;
