# DEPARTMENT OF STATE TELEGRAM
**UNCLASSIFIED**

::: {.cable-meta}
:::


1.  **Figures recently made public by YPFB** show petroleum production here during January-September 1979 fell 15 percent compared to the same period in 1978. (During the first three quarters of this year YPFB produced 7.61 million barrels; during the same nine months last year production was 8.96 million.)

2.  **With the country's oil production-consumption currently in rough balance** (see para 4), further production slippage would soon require Bolivia to begin using its ever scarcer foreign exchange to import costly spot market crude and/or product. However, that painful step may not be necessary in the short or medium run. Increasingly strong inductions are that Dallas-based Tesoro Petroleum's La Vertiente field in southern Bolivia could soon produce enough petroleum to allow YPFB to avoid imports. After having drilled five holes on the structure (one which, ironically, YPFB drilled unsuccessfully hears ago) Tesoro believes La Vertiente could pump 10 to 12 thousand barrels per day, or one half national consumption. (However, far from being euphoric over their success, Tesoro is seriously worried that it will attract too much attention and generate left-wing sentiment for nationalization.)

3.  **Gas marketing remains a problem:** It's increasingly clear that Bolivian hopes of selling additional quantities of higher-priced natural gas to neighboring Argentina are groundless. Moreover, it now appears that the Argentines are unwilling even to agree to a real price hike for the volumes of gas they are now receiving from Bolivia. Recent Argentine gas discoveries support the GOA's hardline posotion on purchases from Bolivia. The new government is, however, pressing agead with drilling to verify its gas reserves, preparatory to pipeline negotiations with Brazil.

4.  **Bolivia's current supply-demand status:** With production falling and demand still increasing Bolivia is still barely able to supply itself with petroleum. By refining all of its current output, YPFB can just supply the country's demand for diesel, fuel oil and kerosene while producing a modest gasoline surplus.
