# DEPARTMENT OF STATE TELEGRAM
**UNCLASSIFIED**

::: {.cable-meta}
:::


1. EMBASSY WISHES TO CALL THE ATTENTION OF THE DEPARTMENT
AND USDEL LOS CONFERENCE CARACAS TO THE REFERENCED MESSAGES,
CONCERNING A PROPOSED VISIT OF PROFESSOR CHARLES COCHRAN, US
NAVAL ACADEMY, TO A PRIVATE-SPONSORED CONFERENCE IN LA PAZ
OCTOBER 24-26 ON THE SUBJECT OF "LAW OF THE SEA: POST CARACAS".
ACCORDING TO INFORMATION SUPPLIED BY THE US NAVAL ACADEMY,
PROFESSOR COCHRAN WISHES TO ATTEND THE CONFERENCE IN ORDER TO
GATHER INFORMATION AND EXCHANGE IDEAS ON STATE RESPONSIBILITY
AND LIABILITY IN THE AREA OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, WHILE
ALSO STUDYING THE DEVELOPMENT OF DISPUTE SETTLEMENT MECHANISMS
FOR A NEW LOS STRUCTURE.


2. THE EMBASSY WISHES TO INFORM THE DEPARTMENT OF CERTAIN
CONSIDERATIONS WHICH AFFECT THE ADVISABILITY OF GRANTING
COUNTRY CLEARANCE FOR PROFESSOR COCHRAN'S ATTENDANCE AT
THE SUBJECT CONFERENCE. FOR THE PAST SIX MONTHS, THE GOB
HAS BEEN ENGAGED IN AN INTENSIVE PUBLICITY AND PROPAGANDA






 092243Z


CAMPAIGN TO STIMULATE INTERNATIONAL AWARENESS OF ITS CLAIM




                      

                  

TO AN ACCESS TO THE SEA. BOLIVIAN DELEGATIONS TO MOST RECENT
INTERNATIONAL MEETINGS AND CONFFERENCES, INCLUDING THE LOS
CONFERENCE IN CARACAS, HAVE TAKEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO RAISE
THIS SENSITIVE ISSUE, WHICH AS THE DEPARTMENT IS AWARE AFFECTS
PRIMARILY THE NATIONAL INTERESTS OF BOLIVIA ITSSELF AND OF ITS
TWO WESTERN NEIGHBORS: CHILE AND PERU. IT IS NOT UNLIKELY
THAT BOLIVIA ALSO WILL SEEK TO USE A REGIONAL LEGAL
CONFERENCE ON LOS, ESPECIALLY ONE TAKING PLACE IN LA PAZ, TO
SEEK TO OBTAIN A RESOLTUION SUPPORTING THE GOB'S CURRENT
POLITICAL OBJECTIVES IN THIS REGARD; THE POSITION OF A U.S.
DELEGATE TO THE CONFERENNCE COULD THEN BECOME ESPECIALLY DELICATE,
DUE TO THE GOB'S DESIRE TO ELICIT EXPRESSIONS OF SUPPORT FROM
ANY INDIVIDUAL WHO HAS OFFICIAL LINKS TO THE US GOVERNMENT.


3. IN ADDITION, THE FOREIGN MINISTRY'S DIRECTOR-GENERAL OF
INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, DR. MOISES FUENTES, HAS INDICATED
TO US THAT THIS CONFERENCE IS BEING PRIVATELY SPONSORED AND
ORGANIZED BY DR. FEDERICO NIELSEN REYES, A POLITICAL OPPORTUNIST
WHO HAS MADE SOMETHING OF A REPUTATION FOR HIMSELF AS AN IDEOLOGUE
OF BOLIVIA'S "RIGHT" TO AN ACCESS TO THE SEA. NIELSEN WAS RECENTLY
NAMED A MEMBER OF THE GOB'S "MARITIME COMMISSION," WHICH IS
CHARGED WITH DEVELOPING NEW STRATEGIES FOR THE ATTAINMENT
OF THE DESIRED OUTLET TO THE PACIFIC OCEAN. WE BELIEVE
THAT IT WOULD BE OUT OF CHARACTER FOR AN INDIVIDUAL OF NIELSEN'S
BACKGROUND NOT TO ATTEMPT TO USE THIS CONFERENCE FOR THE PURPOSE
OF DRUMMING UP SUPPORT FOR THE CAUSE TO WHICH HE HAS
DEVOTED A GREAT PROPORTION OF HIS ATTENTION IN RECENT YEARS.


4. THE EMBASSY WOULD APPRECIATE RECEIVING THE DEPARTMENT'S
VIEWS REGARDING THE ADVISABILITY OF GRANTING COUNTRY CLEARANCE
FOR THIS VISIT, IN VIEW OF THE CONSIDERATIONS NOTED IN PARAGRAPHS
TWO AND THREE.
STEDMAN
