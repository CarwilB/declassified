# DEPARTMENT OF STATE TELEGRAM
**UNCLASSIFIED**

1. DOMESTIC CONSUMPTION OF PETROLEUM ABOUT 880,000 CUBIC METERS,
OF NATURAL GAS ABOUT 1,745 CUBIC METERS OF COAL
ABOUT 6 METRIC TONS AND HYDROELECTRICITY ABOUT 712.5 GWH.
UTILIZATION OF THESE ENERGY SOURCES BY SECTORS IS ABOUT
AS FOLLOWS:
AGRI - PETROLEUM 5 PERCENT OF TOTAL
HYDROELECTRIC 10 PERCENT OF TOTAL
TRANSPORT PETROLEUM 70PERCENT OF TOTAL
MINING HYDROELECTRICITY 35PERCENT OF TOTAL
PETRO/THERMO 4PERCENT OF TOTAL
MANUFACTURING HYDO/ELECT 18PERCENT OF TOTAL
OTHER PETROLEUM 21PERCENT OF TOTAL
HYDROLECTRIC 37PERCENT OF TOTAL
NATURAL GAS (BOTTLED) 20PERCENT OF TOTAL
NATURAL GAS (THERMO/ELECT FEEDSTOCK) 80PERCENT OF TOTAL

2. THE CONSUMER COST OF ELECTRIC POWER VARIES WIDELY THROUGHOUT




                       

                  

COUNTRY, RESULTING IN AN UNWEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF .44PESOS PER
KWH WITH A RANGE OF .227-.61 PESOS PER KWH FOR HOUSEHOLDS ONLY.
INDUSTRIAL, ETC. COSTS NOTAVAILABLE
3. TEH GOB TO OUR KNOWLEDGE HAS NOT FORMULATED ANY CLEAR ENERGY
POLICY SO FAR, BUT CERTAIN ELEMENTS, AT LEAST, OF GOB
INTERESTED INEXPLOITING MORE FULLY THE VAST HYDRO-
ELECTRIC POTENTIAL OF COUNTRY. APPARENTLY LARGE DAM PROJECTS SUCH AS
BALA NOT GENERALLY REQUIRED BECASUE NATURAL RIVER FLOW
SUFFICIENT FOR GENERATION.
USE OF PETROLEUM FOR FEEDSTOCKS TO FERTILIZER AND OTHER PETRO-
CHEMICAL INDUSTRIES BEING WIDELY DISCUSSED.
4.DRAMATIC INCREASES IN FERTILIZER IMPORT COSTS AS WELL AS GENERAL
INCREASES IN COST OF OTHER PETROLEUM BASED PRODUCTS (EXCEPT VEHICLE
FUEL PRICES) HAVE CAUSED SEVERE PROBLEMS IN VARIOUS SECTORS OF
THE BOLIVIAN ECONOMY--PARTICULARLY FOR AGRICULTURAL WHICH
PROCEEDINGS TOWARD THE USE OF MODERN
INPUTS (FERTILIZER, INSECTICES, TRACTORS, ETC.). THE RISING COST
OF PETROLEUM WILL MORE THAN LIKELY SLOW THIS PROCESS OR MORE REALIS-
TICALLY, CAUSE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT PRICES TO RAISE SUBSTANTIALLY
UNTIL A NEW EQUILIBRIUM COST STRUCTURE IS ESTABLISHED. THE MISSION
CONSIDERS THIS IMPACT TO BE EXTREMELY DETRIMENTTAL IN LIGHT OF EXIST-
ING WORLD WIDE PRESSURE OF FOOD STOCKS. THE ABILITY OF BOLIVIA TO
SOLVE ITS AGRICULTURAL PROBLEMS IN THE SHORT TERM ARE NOW FURTHER
CONSTRAINED.
