# DEPARTMENT OF STATE TELEGRAM
**UNCLASSIFIED**

1. WISH TO CLARIFY PARA 1 REF B. WE ARE CURRENTLY THINKING
THAT WE WILL INCLUDE CROP SUBSTITUTION EFFORT FOR FY 1975
APART FROM PILOT STUDIES AS PART OF AGRICULTURE SECTOR LOAN PLANNED
FOR FY 1975, ALTHOUGH IF TURNS OUT NOT TO BE FEASIBLE, WE WILL
TREAT PROJECT AS SEPARATE OPERATION. ADVANTAGE OF INCLUSION IN
AGSECTOR LOAN WOULD BE THAT IT WOULD ASSURE FULL CONCORDANCE WITH
OVERALL GOB EFFORTS AND THAT SUBSTITUTION EFFORT WOULD TAKE INTO
CONSIDERATION COLLATERAL NEED FOR WORK ON RESEARCH AND MARKETING
QUESTIONS. FIRST STEP PROCESS WOULD BE EVALUATION REPORT US
DEPARTMENT AGRICULTURE TEAM WHICH SCHEDULED ARRIVE MAY 13.


2. PILOT PROJECTS WOULD TEST ECONOMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE AS
WELL AS TECHNICAL POSSIBILITY ACHIEVE LASTING CROP SUBSTITUTION
RESULTS. CREDIT AND OTHER RESOURCES FOR SUBSTITUTION WOULD BE
GEARED TO SUPPORT PILOT PROJECTS AND WOULD BE INCREASED AS
EXPERIENCE WITH PILOT PROJECTS JUSTIFIES.
