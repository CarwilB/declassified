# DEPARTMENT OF STATE TELEGRAM
**UNCLASSIFIED**

::: {.cable-meta}
:::


1. REGRETABLE THAT SUBJECT MESSAGE NOT CLEARED OR COORDINATED
WITH THE EMBASSY'S POLITICAL SECTION. APART FROM MINOR ERRORS
FROM SOURCES SUCH AS STATEMENTS THAT THE ARMY HAS A ROLE IN
PRICE CONTROLS (IT DOES NOT), OR THAT PRICE INCREASES WERE
ABOUT 300 PERCENT (THEY WERE ABOUT 100 PERCENT) WHICH COULD
HAVE BEEN CORRECTED IN THE COMMENT, THE COMMENT ITSELF
IS IN ERROR WHEN IT SUGGESTS THAT THE PRESIDENT'S VERY
DIFFICULT DECISION TO IMPLEMENT THE LATEST ECONOMIC
PACKAGE WAS MADE TO PLACATE THE POLITICIANS AND THEREBY
STAY IN OFFICE. POLITICIANS IN BOLIVIA AT THIS TIME HAVE
NEITHER THE DESIRE TO ALIENATE THE PUBLIC AT LARGE NOR
THE CLOUT TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THE PRESIDENT STAYS
IN OFFICE.


2. THE EMBASSY DOES NOT WISH TO SUGGEST THAT THE ARMY IS
SOLIDLY BEHIND BANZER. IT ISN'T NOW AND NEVER HAS BEEN.
IT MAY EVEN BE LESS SOLIDLY BEHIND THE PRESIDENT NOW THAN A
FEW MONTHS AGO BECAUSE THERE HAS BEEN, AFTER ALL,






 292338Z


RATHER WIDE-SPREAD CRITICISM OF THE WAY THE GOV HAS HANDLED




                      

                 

NATIONAL ECONOMIC PROBLEMS SINCE LAST OCTOBER. ON THE OTHER
HAND, IT IS HIGHLY IMPROBABLE THAT GENERAL ALCOREZA WOULD
HAVE TOLD A LARGE GROUP OF CADETS THAT THE ARMY WOULD DUMP
BANZER IF HE APPEARS TO LOSE SUPPORT, AS STATED IN REFTEL.


3. THE EMBASSY AGREES THAT THERE MAY BE GROWING SENTIMENTS
WITHIN THE MILITARY FOR A CHANGE IN THE PRESIDENCY. THE
EMBASSY HAS REPORTED THE RATHER PERSISTENT TALK ABOUT THE
PROSPECTS OF A MILITARY JUNTA OR AN ALL-MILITARY CABINET.
HOWEVER, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THIS IS THE TIME FOR EITHER,
BECAUSE NEITHER WOULD BE ABLE TO PRESENT NEW SOLUTIONS TO
THE EXISTING PROBLEMS. THE MILITARY DOES NOT WISH TO BEAR
THE FULL BRUNT OF GENERAL CRITICISM AND IS UNLIKELY TO PUT
ITSELF IN THIS POSITION. ALSO REPORTED IN THE PAST HAS
BEEN THE EXTRAORDINARY EFFECTIVENESS OF THE GOB IN DISCOVERING AND
CRUSHING COUP PLOTS.


4. IN SUM, THE GOB IS FACING PROBLEMS AT THIS TIME AS THE
DEPARTMENT KNOWS, BUT WE BELIEVE BANZER'S SURVIVAL PROSPECTS
CONTINUE TO BE GOOD.
STEDMAN
