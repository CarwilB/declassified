1. BIO NOTES FOLLOW BELOW ON SEVEN NEW MINISTERS IN THE
ALL-MILITARY CABINET SWORN IN BY PRESIDENT BANZER ON 8
JULY 1974:


2. JUAN LECHIN SUAREZ - MINISTER OF COORDINTION - THE 53-
YEAR OLD LECHIN IS ARETIRED BRIGADIER GENERAL. A FULL BIO-
REPORT ON HIM DATED JANUARY 1971 IS CONTAINED IN THE BIO-
GRAPHIC HANDBOOK, THE REPORT CARRIES HIS CAREER UP TO HIS
APPOINTMENT AS AMBASSADOR TO THE UK AND THE NETHERLANDS, A
POST HE HELD UNTIL ABOUT A MONTH AGO. LECHIN IS A MODERATE
CONSERVATIVE WITH BROAD ADMINISTRATIVE EXPERIENCE (E.G.
PRESIDENT OF THE BOLIVIAN MINING CORPORATION FROM 1964 TO
1968). LECHIN HAS A GOOD REPUTATION AMONG MILITARY AND
CIVILIANS ALIKE.
3. VICTOR CASTILLO SUAREZ - MINISTER OF FINANCE - COL CAS-
TILLO WAS BORN IN 1924. HE WAS UNTIL RECENTLY HEAD OF THE
MILITARY SCHOOL IN COCHABAMBA (INCLUDING THE COMMAND AND
GENERAL STAFF SCHOOL). THE ARMA HAS BEEN IMPRESSED WITH HIS

SOLID COMPETENCE, BUT HE APPARENTLY HAS NO SPECIAL QUALIFI-




                      

                   

CATIONS FOR THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE. SOME COLLEAGUES BELIEVE
HE MAY BE EASILY INFLUENCED BY HIS STAFF.
4. GENERAL RENE BERNAL ESCALANTE-MINISTER OF DEFENSE A 50-
YEAR OLD ARMY OFFICER, HE HAS UNTIL RECENTLY BEEN CHIEF OF
THE COMBINED STAFF. HE HAS SERVED AS MILITARY ATTACHE IN
WASHINGTON (A HAPPY MEMORABLE EXPERIENCE FOR HIM) AND HAS
BEEN VERY CLOSE AND HELPFUL TO MEMBERS OF THE USMILGRP IN
BOLIVIA. HE WAS ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL HIGH RANKING OFFICERS
INTERESTED IN EXAMINING THE ACQUISITION OF SOVIET MILITARY
EQUIPMENT. HOWEVER, HE RECE DENIED REAL INTEREST AND EXPLAINED
HIS PARTICIPATION TO THE AMBASSADOR BY SAYING THAT HIS ROLE
CONSISTED SOLELY IN REPLYING POLITELY TO OFFERS PRESSED ON
HIM BY THE SOVIET EMBASSY. BERNAL WAS MINISTER OF CAMPESINO
AFFAIRS FROM 1964 TO 1966 AND IS BELIEVED TO BE HIGHLY IN-
TERESTED AND INFORMED ON CAMPESINO MATTERS.
5. LT COL WALDO BERNAL PEREIRA MINISTER OF EDUCATION A FORTY
YEAR OLD AIR FORCE OFFICER, BERNAL WAS CHIEF OF THE PRESI-
DENTIAL HOUSEHOLD. HE HAS BEEN TO THREE US AIR FORCE SCHOOLS
AND SPEAKS GOOD ENGLISH. HE DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF AS COMMANDER
OF THE SANTA CRUZ AIR FORCE ACADEMY. HE HAS BEEN DESCRIBED
AS HIGHLY PROFESSIONAL, PREGMATIC AND VERY CLOSE TO PRESIDENT
BANZER BOTH POLITICALLY AND PERSONNALLY.
6. COL ANTONIO ZELAYA S. MINISTER OF MINING ZELAYA IS A 47
YEAR OLD ARMY ENGINEER WHO IS A GEOGRAPHER AND GEODESIST.
HE HAS HELD MANY MILITARY AND CIVILIAN SCIENTIFIC AND ACA-
DEMIC POSITIONS (INCLUDING RECTOR OF THE UNIVERSITY OF LA
PAZ VERY BRIEFLY). HE IS THE MILITARY PRESIDENT OF THE CENTER
OF GRADUATES OF THE SCHOOL OF HIGH MILITARY STUDIES. HIS
TECHNICAL BACKGROUND SHOULD BE USEFUL, AS THE MINISTRY GIVES
GREATER EMPHASIS TO EXPLORATION FOR NEW MINING SITES.
7. CAPTAIN WALTER NUNEZ RIVERO MINISTER OF TRANSPORTATION
AND COMMUNICATIONS NUNEZ IS A 44 YEAR OLD NAVAL OFFICER. HE
RETURNED FROM LIMA WHERE HE WAS BOLIVIAN NAVAL ATTACHE TO
TAKE OVER THE MINISTRY. OLD REPORTS INDICATE THAT HE WAS
DYNAMIC AND RESPECTED NAVAL OFFICER, BUT THAT HE APPEARED
TO HAVE ENRICHED HIMSELF FROM SEVERAL OF HIS ASSIGNMENTS.
HE IS STRONG PROPONENT OF DEVELOPING THE WATERWAYS TRANS-
PORTATION IN THE NORTH AND EAST SECTIONS OF THE COUNTRY.






 110327Z


8. LT COL MARIO VARGAS SALINAS MINISTER OF LABOR VARGAS WAS
UNTIL RECENTLY PRESIDENT OF THE BOLIVIAN DEVELOPMENT CORP-
PRATION (CBF). HE WAS REPORTEDLY GIVEN THE CBF BECAUSE OF HIS
HIGH STANDING AMONG THE YOUNGER OFFICERS AND TO REMOVE HIM
FROM THE RANKS OF THOSE PLOTTING AGAINST THE BANZER REGIME.
HE HAS LOST STANDING WITH THE YOUNGER OFFICERS BUT SENIOR
OFFICERS CONSIDER HIM A STRONG PERFORMER. HE USED HIS POSITION
WITH THE CBF TO DEMONSTRATE HIS ORGANIZATIONAL ABILITIES.
HE IS POLITICALLY AMBITIOUS AND AS MINISTER OF LABOR WILL BE
IN AN IDEAL POSITION TO BUILD A POLITICAL FOLLOWING.




                   

                 


9. WE EXPECT TO SEND ADDITINAL FACTS AND COMMENTARY ON THESE
INDIVIDUALS OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS.
