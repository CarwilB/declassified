# DEPARTMENT OF STATE TELEGRAM
**UNCLASSIFIED**

1. The mission has in a very limited number of special cases supplemented salaries of key Bolivian civil servants whose training, experience and ability make them uniquely qualified to advance crucial elements of the GOB cooperative program with the mission. This is done to encourage such personnel to remain in key positions of leadership within the government in the face of employment offers from other agencies, multinational or private sector, which offer remuneration substantially above GOB civil service scale. In this sense we top off the salary for a fixed time period until, hopefully, GOB civil service scale for the position is adjusted upward and encourage the key leader not to leave the country or the GOB.

2. Winston Estremadoiro is a Bolivian leader who fits these criteria. He completed a Bachelor's degree at the University of Houston, a Master's degree at the University of California, Los Angeles, and is a candidate for the Ph.D. at UCLA (lacking only his dissertation for graduation). His fields of expertise are rural sociology and social anthropology. In addition to having worked with indigenous leaders in most geographic areas of Bolivia, he organized, then administered, PRODES (Project for the Development of the Chapare and Yungas) for two years with a high degree of success.

3. Mr. Estremadoiro is a natural leader, is highly motivated, and knows how to move programs and projects through the Bolivian government and society. In our opinion he will be a key element in any development effort we help finance in the coca zones. He has had several attractive offers to leave the GOB (from the Andean Pact and the Organization of American States among others). We propose to supplement his salary as Executive Director of PRODES, now fixed by the GOB at US $736 per month ($B 15,000), if he agrees to return to that important position. While no negotiations have been completed with Mr. Estremadoiro pending approval of relevant USG agencies, we would propose to supplement his GOB salary by up to US $1,025 per month. This would bring his total salary up to a level equal to his current earnings under contract and would approximate the offers he has received from other non-GOB entities.
