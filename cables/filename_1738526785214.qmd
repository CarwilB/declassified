# DEPARTMENT OF STATE TELEGRAM
**UNCLASSIFIED**

1. BEGIN . ACCORDING TO CHECK WITH MININD/COM JAN. 8
COMMERCIAL IMPORTS OF W EAT AND FLOUR IN 1973 TOTALED 90,268 M.T.
IN WHEAT EQUIVALENT. FOUR YEAR AVERAGE FOR 1969-1972 IS 124,875
M.T.; THEREFORE FIVE YEAR AVERAGE IS 117,953 M.T. OF WHEAT
EQUIVALENT.
END .


2. BEGIN . FYI. WE DO NOT HAVE MUCH
CONFIDENCE IN FIGURE FOR 1973 GIVEN US TODAY BY MININD/COM AS
FOURTH QUARTER COMPONENT IS ONLY 6,888 M.T. WHE*T EQUIVALENT. THIS
FIGURE EXTREMELY LOW EVEN IN VIEW CHRONIC FLOUR SHORTAGES LA PAZ
AND OTHER BOLIVIAN CITIES IN FOURTH QUARTER. WE SUSPECT CONSIDERABLE
ADDITIONAL QUANTITIES OF "IRREGULAR" FLOUR IMPORTS OCCURRED DURING
QUARTER ALTHOUGH MININD/COM HAS NO OFFICIAL RECORD OF THESE.

3. WE HAVE OBTAINED COPY OF TABLE GIVEN TO MINFON BY MININD/COM
WHICH PRESUMABLY IS ONE OF TABLES PASSED ON TO EEC. OFFICIALS
WHO MIGHT BE ABLE EXPLAIN TABLE ARE NOW IN BUENOS AIRES TRYING
TO IMPROVE ARGENTINE PERFORMANCE ON ITS COMMITMENTS TO BOLIVIA.
WE BELIEVE TABLE CONSTRUCTED ABOUT AUGUST 2, 1973 WHEN MININD/COM
JUST BEGINNING TO LOOK AT SUPPLY SITUATION WITH ALMOST ENTIRELY
NEW STAFF. TABLE SHOWS ESTIMATED COMMERCIAL IMPORTS IN 1973 OF
135,277 M.T. IN WHEAT EQUIVALENT WHICH WE BELIEVE IMPLIES A
LEVEL OF CONTRABAND IMPORTS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER FAR ABOVE
WHAT IS LIKELY. TABLE PUTS ESTIMATED COMMERCIAL IMPORTS AT 165,319
M.T. WHEAT EQUIVALENT IN 1974 WHICH WE UNDERSTAND FROM EARLIER
CABLES WAS TRIMMED TO 145,000 M.T. LATER. IT SHOULD BE UNDERSTOOD
THAT NEITHER OF THESE ESTIMATES BEARS ANY RELATIONSHIP TO THE
UMR AS CALCULATED FOR PL-480 TITLE I PURPOSES MICH IS GENERALLY AN
AVERAGE OF OMMERCIAL IMPORTS OVER PRECEEDING FIVE YEARS.
IT MAY BE, HOWEVER, THAT BOLIVIA WILL BE FORCED TO IMPORT
COMMERCIALLY WHEAT AND FLOUR IN 1974 TO THE EXTENT
INDICATED IN THE TABLE DUE TO POSSIBLE UNAVAILABILITY OF PL-480
