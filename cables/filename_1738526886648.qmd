# DEPARTMENT OF STATE TELEGRAM
**UNCLASSIFIED**

1. SUMMARY: PRESIDENT BANZER TOOK OPPORTUNITY COURTESY CALL BY
USCINCSO GENERAL ROSSON AND ME TO REQUEST USG CONSIDER GUARANTEEING
BOLIVIAN NEUTRALITY IN EVENT PERUVIAN/CHILEAN CONFLICT. ALSO STATED
THAT BOLIVIA NEEDS A MINIMUM MILITARY CAPABILITY TO DEFEND ITS TERRITORY


IN EVENT BOLIVIA INVOLVED IN PERU/CHILEAN ARMED OPERATIONS.
PRESIDENT SAID THIS CONCERN IS ONE HE HAS LONG HELD AND WOULD HAVE
RAISED WITH PRESIDENT NIXON IF HE HAD MADE TRIP TO U.S. IN OCT.
1973 AND WOULD SURELY RAISE WITH PRESIDENT FORD WERE HE TO HAVE
OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE TRIP TO U.S. DURING HIS TERM IN OFFICE.


2. ON SEPT 5 GENERAL ROSSON, USCINCSO, AND I MADE EARLY MORING
COURTESY CALL ON PRESIDENT BANZER. AFTER USUAL EXCHANGE OF
PLEASANTRIES, GENERAL ROSSON NOTED IMPROVEMENT IN BOLIVIAN ARMED
FORCES OVER THAT HE OBSERVED LAST YEAR. GENERAL ROSSON STRESSED
MARKED PROGRESS IN MAINTENANCE CAPABILITY OF SEVERAL UNITS.
ROSSON ALSO NOTED STRENGTHENED BALANCE OF PAYMENT SITUATION.
PRESIDENT ACKNOWLEDGED DEGREE OF IMPROVEMENT BUT SAID THAT RATE
OF ADVANCEMENT NOT AS FAST AS HE AND THE ARMED FORCES WISHED. HE
ALSO NOTED THAT POLITICAL STABILITY WAS KEY FACTOR REQUIRED TO

ENABLE THE COUNTRY TO EXPLOIT ITS RICHES AND TO BENEFIT FROM




                     

                   

PRESENT HIGH LEVEL OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE EARNINGS FROM MINERALS
EXPORTS. PRESIDENT THEN SAID HE HAD A DEEP-SEATED CONCERN WHICH
HE HAD HELD FOR A LONG TIME AND WISHED TO TELL US ABOUT BECAUSE
IT IS A MATTER OF GRAVE IMPORTANCE TO BOLIVIA. HE SAID HE HAS
BEEN AND IS TROUBLED ABOUT THE NEAR-TERM PROSPECT OF ARMED CONFLICT
BETWEEN PERU AND CHILE AND THE PROBABLE INVOLVEMENT OF BOLIVIA.


3. PRESIDENT BANZER SAID THAT HE HAD HAD THE OPPORTUNITY DURING
HIS 25 YEARS OF MILITARY SERVICE TO MEET AND KNOW PERUVIANS AND
CHILEANS, MILITARY AND CIVILANS, FROM LOW-RANKING TO HIGH
AUTHORITIES. HE SAID HE HAD ATTENDED CONFERENCES, BEEN ON
MISSIONS, AND SERVED IN OTHER COUNTRIES SUCH AS THE U.S. AS
MILITARY ATTACHE, AND HAD GOTTEN TO KNOW PERUVIAN AND CHILEAN
THINKING ABOUT ONE ANOTHER. RECENTLY HE HAD HAD PRIVATE CONVERSA-
TIONS WITH PRESIDENT VELASCO OF PERU AND PRESIDENT PINOCHET OF
CHILE. BOTH MEN EXPRESSED TO HIM FEELINGS WHICH BANZER HIMSELF
SAID HE HAD OBSERVED ARE STRONGLY HELD BY THE PEOPLE OF BOTH
COUNTRIES. IN THE CASE OF PERU, THERE IS A FERVENT DESIRE TO
RECONQUER TERRITORIES LOST IN THE WAR OF THE PACIFIC. IN THE
CASE OF CHILE, THERE IS A FIRM CONVICTION THAT IT WILL DEFEND
TERRITORIES NOW UNDER ITS SOVEREIGN CONTROL. PRESIDENT BANZER
SAID THAT HE HAS CONCLUDED THAT IN THE SHORT OR IN THE MEDIUM
TERM THERE WILL BE ARMED CONFLICT BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES. HE
IS CONVINCED THAT EVEN THOUGH BOLIVIAN POLICY IS NEUTRALITY, HIS
COUNTRY WILL BE INVOLVED AGAINST ITS WILL. HE NOTED, FOR EXAMPLE,
THAT A PERUVIAN MILITARY OFFICER NOW HOLDING A HIGH POSITION IN
THE GOP, WHEN A MEMBER OF THE INTER-AMERICAN DEFENSE BOARD SOME
YEARS AGO, HAD REVEALED TO HIM, WHEN HE WAS MILITARY ATTACHE IN
WASHINGTON, PERUVIAN WAR PLANS WHICH INVOLVED USE OF BOLIVIAN
AIR SPACE. BANZER SAID THAT THE PERUVIAN PLANS INCLUDE THE USE
OF AIRPORTS BUILT BUT NOT NOW USED (HE SAID THAT HE HIMSELF KNOWS
NONE OF SUCH AIRPORT) TO LAUNCH AIR STRIKES FROM PERU INTO BOLIVIA
TO PASS SOUTH BEHIND THE BOLIVAN CORDILLERA AND THEN INTO
CHILEAN TERRITORY. PRESIDENT BANZER NOTED FURTHER THAT THE
PROBLEM IS NOT MERELY A THREE-CORNERED PROBLEM INVOLVING BOLIVIA,
CHILE, AND PERU, BUT WILL INVOLVE MANY OTHER LATIN AMERICAN
COUNTRIES. BRAZIL WILL SURELY BACK CHILE. PARAGUAY WILL
SYMPATHIZE WITH BRAZIL AND CHILE BECAUSE OF ITS IDEOLOGICAL
COMPATIBILITY. THE ARGENTINE POSITION IS NOT NOW CLEAR BECAUSE
OF THE MUDDLED SITUATION THERE.

4. PRESIDENT BANZER SAID THAT THE PERUVIAN/CHILEAN PROBLEM IS
NOW SEVERELY AGGRAVATED BY THE TOTALLY OPPOSITE IDEOLOGIES OF
THE TWO COUNTRIES. HE ALSO NOTED THAT THE ARMED FORCES OF BOTH
COUNTRIES HAVING TALKED ABOUT RECONQUEST AND DEFENSE FOR SO
MANY YEARS NOW HAVE A PASSIONATELY HELD DOCTRINE. HE SAID THAT
HE HAS EVIDENCE THAT PERU HAS ATTEMPTED TO INFLUENCE DOMESTIC
POLITICAL EVENTS IN BOLIVIA TO BRING ABOUT A REGIME MORE COMPATIBLE




                   

                   

WITH THE PRESENT ONE IN LIMA. WHILE HISTORY MIGHT SUGGEST THAT
BOLIVIA WOULD SIDE WITH PERU BECAUSE THEY BOTH LOST IN THE WAR OF
THE PACIFIC, THE PRESENT IDEOLOGICAL SITUATION IN PERU
PROMPTS BOLIVIA TO ADOPT ITS BASIC POLICY OF NEUTRALITY.
PRESIDENT BANZER SAID THAT PERUVIAN PRESIDENT VELASCO TOLD HIM
THAT BOLIVIA MAY WORK OUT AN ACCESS TO THE SEA WITH CHILE,
BUT IT WOULD BE WORTHLESS IF IT INCLUDED FORMER PERUVIAN
TERRITORY BECAUSE PERU INTENDS TO RECONQUER THAT AREA.


5. PRESIDENT BANZER STRESSED THE FUNDAMENTAL POLICY OF BOLIVIA
THAT IT BE NEUTRAL IN THE EVENT OF CONFLICT BETWEEN PERU AND
CHILE, BUT HE EMPHASIZED THAT BECAUSE BOLIVIA MIGHT INEVITABLY
BE INVOLVED AND HAS LIMITED CAPABILITY TO DEFEND ITS TERRITORY,
IT NEEDS A GUARANTEE, BOTH MILITARY AND MORAL, OF A FRIENDLY AND
STRONG COUNTRY. THE U.S. IS THE OBVIOUS CHOICE AMONG BOLIVIA'S
FRIENDS TO PROVIDE THIS GUARANTEE. ALSO HE SAID THAT BOLIVIA
NEEDS A MINIMUM MILITARY CAPABILITY TO PROTECT ITS TERRITORIAL
SOVEREIGNTY IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT. HE SAID THAT HE WOULD
BE DERELICT IN HIS DUTIES IF HE DID NOT ENSURE THAT BOLIVIA'S
FORCES ARE AT LEAST ABLE TO MOVE TO THE FRONTIERS TO PROTECT
THEM AGAINST INCURSIONS FROM EITHER PERU OR CHILE. HE SAID
THIS SUBJECT HAD BEEN RAISED LY IN THE MARCH 1974
COCHABAMBA CONSULTATIVE MEETING BUT HAS BEEN KEPT OUT OF THE
BOLIVIAN PRESS. HE SAID THAT THE ISSUE IS ONE WHICH HE CANNOT
RAISE PUBLICLY IN BOLIVIA BECAUSE THE BOLIVIANS WILL BELIEVE THAT
HE IS SEEKING TO EXPLOIT THE SITUATION TO MAINTAIN HIMSELF IN OFFICE.
IN THIS REGARD, HE SAID THAT HE AND HIS GOVERNMENT ARE FIRMLY
WEDDED TO HOLDING ELECTIONS IN 1975 AND TO TURNING THE GOVERNMENT
OVER TO THE ELECTED PRESIDENT.


6. PRESIDENT BANZER ASKED GENERAL ROSSO AND ME TO TRANSMIT
TO THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT FOR SERIOUS
CONSIDERATION HIS PERSONAL APPEAL FOR A GUARANTEE OF BOLIVIAN
  SECRET

 052142Z


NEUTRALITY AND FOR THE NECESSARY MINIMUM MILITARY DEFENSIVE
CAPABILITY, BASED ON HIS CONCERN THAT BOLIVIA WOULD BE DRAWN
INTO A PERUVIAN/CHILEAN CONFLICT WHICH HE FEARS IS COMING SOON.
HE NOTED THAT HE WAS NOT MAKING A "DENUNCIA" BUT WAS PRESENTING
FACTS AS THEY NOW EXIST.


7. GENERAL ROSSON SPOKE FOR HIMSELF AND ME, THANKING PRESIDENT
BANZER FOR HIS CLEAR AND CONCISE STATEMENT OF BOLIVIA'S CONCERNS
AND SAID THAT THEY WOULD BE TRANSMITTED TO WASHINGTON AS THE
PRESIDENT HAD REQUESTED. THE CONVERSATION THEN CLOSED WITH
EXPRESSIONS OF TRADITIONAL FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN THE U.S. AND
BOLIVIA.


8. COMMENT AND CTION REQUESTED: PRESIDENT BANZER APPEARED
SINCERELY TROUBLED ABOUT THE PERUVIAN/CHILEAN SITUATION. ACCORD-




                   

                   

INGLY, I URGE THAT THE DEPARTMENT ARRANGE FOR THE HIGHEST
POSSIBLE REVIEW OF PRESIDENT BANZER'S REQUEST AND, TO THE EXTENT
POSSIBLE, OBTAIN AS POSITIVE A REPLY AS WE CAN MAKE TO HIM
ABOUT MAINTENANCE OF BOLIVIA'S NEUTRALITY IN THE EVENT OF A
PERUVIAN/CHILEAN CONFLICT. AS TO THE MINIMUM MILITARY CAPACITY,
AN EXPRESSION OF COOPERATION AND FORTHCOMINGNESS RELATED TO
THE MAP GRANT MATERIEL PROGRAM AND FUTURE FMS CREDIT LEVELS
WOULD BE APPROPRIATE. A LETTER FROM PRESIDENT FORD ON THESE
TWO POINTS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS A POSSIBLE VEHICLE FOR OUR
REPLY. I ALSO NOTE THAT PRESIDENT BANZER'S REQUEST STRENGTHENS
OUR PROPOSAL THAT THE POLICY PLANNING STAFF VISITS TO LATIN
AMERICA INCLUDE BOLIVIA. IT SHOULD NOT BE OVERLOOKED THAT THE
PRESIDENT BROADLY HINTED THAT HE WOULD LIKE AN INVITATION TO
VISIT THE U.S. IF SUCH A VISIT COULD BE TIMED IN THE EARLY
SPRING OF 1975, BEFORE THE BOLIVIAN ELECTIONS BUT AFTER BANZER
HAS TAKEN HIMSELF OUT OF THE RACE, I BELIEVE IT WOULD HELP
BANZER GUIDE BOLIVIA THROUGH THE CONSTITUTIONAL TRANSITION WITH
LESS INSTABILITY--A MAJOR U.S. OBJECTIVE HERE. SEPARATE TELEGRAM
WILL FOLLOW ELABORATING OUR VIEWS ON A POSSIBLE VISIT OF
PRESIDENT BANZER TO WASHINGTON.


9. DEPT PLEASE PASS DOD/OSD, DOD/JCS, USCINCSO, AND DOD/ISA.
