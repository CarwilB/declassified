# DEPARTMENT OF STATE TELEGRAM
**UNCLASSIFIED**

::: {.cable-meta}
:::


1. EMBASSY BELIEVES REFTEL WITH MINOR CHANGES APTLY DESCRIBES
TRADE PROBLEMS AFFECTING BOLIVIA. THIS TELEGRAM RETRANSMITS
PARAS. 3.A.2., 3.A.3., AND 3.C.1. OF REFTEL WITH EMBASSY'S
SUGGESTED CHANGES.


2. PARA. 3.A.2. - EX-IM BANK CREDITS. THE EX-IM BANK CURRENTLY
REFUSES TO MAKE LOANS OR ISSUE CREDIT GUARANTEE FOR SALES TO BOLIVIA
DUE TO GOB DEFAULT ON DEBTS IN THE PAST AND, MORE RECENTLY, LATE
PAYMENT OF DEBTS. THE GOB HAS MADE STRONG REPRESENTATIONS TO THE
USG ASKING THAT THE EX-IM POLICY BE RECONSIDERED BUT TO NO AVAIL.
THE GOB SEES THE EX-IM POLICY AS A SERIOUS ROADBLOCK IN ACHIEVING
ITS CAPITAL INVESTMENT GOALS, AND AS A PREJUDICIAL USG VIEW OF
BOLIVIA IN LIGHT OF MORE FORTHCOMING ATTITUDE OF BRAZIL, U.K.,
FRG AND JAPAN, AMONG OTHERS.


3. PARA 3.A.3. - SUGAR ACT. THE GOB WILL UNDOUBTEDLY BE
UNHAPPY IF THE SUGAR ACT IS NOT RENEWED. THIS REACTION WILL BE
MUTED SO LONG AS THE INERNATIONAL PRICE REMAINS ABOVE THE QUOTA
PRICE AND WORLD DEMAND REMAINS STRONG, ALTHOUGH GOB MAY YET SEND






 032111Z


US NOTE ON SUBJECT.




                    

                  


4. PARA. 3.C.1. - BOLIVIAN-ARGENTINE TRADE PROBLEMS. THE GOB HAS
BEEN CONCERNED FOR ALMOST A YEAR OVER WHAT IT REGARDS AS GOA NON-
PERFORMANCE ON COMMITMENTS TO BOLIVIA. THE PRIMARY COMPLAINT IS
WITH REGARD TO FULFILLING CONTRACTS TO PROVIDE WHEAT AND FLOUR TO
BOLIVIA AT PRICES AGREED IN 1973 AND WITH APPARENT ARGENTINE FOOT-
DRAGGING ON CONSTRUCTION OF AHIGHWAY FROM POTOSI TO THE ARGENTINE
BOFDER AT BERMEJO. THE GOB IS CONVINCED THAT THIS STANCE REFLECTS
GOA PIQUE WITH THE GO'S DEMANDS TO INCREASE PRICES ON NATURAL GAS
AND PETROLEUM SUPPLIED TO ARGENTINA. THIS SUTUATION MAY
BECOME MORE AGGRAVATED AS A RESULT OF THE RECENT SIGNATURE
OF AN IMPORTANT AGREEMENT BETWEEN BOLIVIA AND BRAZIL WHICH COMMITS
BOLIVIA TO SELL LARGE QUANTITIES OF NATURAL GAS AND PETROLEUM TO
BRAZIL IN EXCHANGE FOR LARGE AMOUNTS OF BRAZILIAN ASSISTANCE.
TALKS TO STRAIGHTEN OUT THE COMPLEX OF ARGENTINE-BOLIVIAN ECONOMIC
RELATIONS (OTHER EXAPLES, GOA WANTS BOLIVIAN IRON ORE AND GOB
WANTS ARGENTINE AVGAS AT LOW PRICE) HAVE NEVER GOTTEN OFF THE
GROUND.
