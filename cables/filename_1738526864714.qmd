# DEPARTMENT OF STATE TELEGRAM
**UNCLASSIFIED**

::: {.cable-meta}
:::


1. IN MY CONVERSATION OF JUNE 20 WITH PRESIDENT BANZER, I DID NOT
MAKE A DETAILED PRESENTATION OF U.S. CONCERN ABOUT GOB RECEIPT OF
SOVIET MILITARY EQUIPMENT. THE PRESIDENT EXPRESSED HIS AWARENESS
OF THE DANGERS OF INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES BY SOVIET TECHNICIANS
AND INTIMATED HIS OPPOSITION TO RECEIPT OF SOVIET EQUIPMENT.
YET HE IS ANXIOUS TO GET MORE UP-TO-DATE MILITARY EQUIPMENT FOR
THE ARMY, PARTICULARLY, TO IMPROVE ITS MORALE. HE MENTIONED THAT
DURING HIS RECENT VISITS TO MILITARY UNITS IN THE WAKE OF THE
COUP ATTEMPT HE FOUND KULL SUPPORT FOR HIMSELF AND THE GOVERNMENT,
BUT WAS QUESTIONED BY MANY YOUNGER OFFICERS ABOUT THE MILITARY
EQUIPMENT THEY HAVE BEEN EXPECTING. I CONCLUDED DURING OUR TALK
THAT WITHOUT SPECIFIC P&A DATA ON A TANK SUBSTITUTE SUCH AS AN
ASSAULT CAR, THE PRESSURE ON US FOR EQUIPMENT WOULD INCREASE IF
I APPLIED MORE PRESSURE ON HIM NOT TO ACCEPT MATERIEL FROM THE
USSR. ALSO I BELIEVE THE ODDS ARE AGAINST THE GOB ACCEPTING
SOVIET EQUIPMENT AND ESPECIALLY TECHNICANS.


2. IF I CAN BE ARMED WITH P&A DATA ON A SUITABLE VEHICLE AS AN
ALTERNATIVE TO A TANK TO GIVE PERSONALLY TO PRESIDENT BANZER, I COULD
THEN, MORE SUCCESSFULLY I BELIEVE, MAKE A DEMARCHE, IF THE
  SECRET


  SECRET


 241732Z


DEPARTMENT WISHES, TO HIM ABOUT SOVIET TANKS. ALTHOUGH HIGH-




                                

                 

RANKING OFFICERS OF THE BOLIVIAN ARMY HAVE SHOWN NO INTEREST IN
CADILLAC-GAGE ASSAULT CARS, PRESIDENT BANZER MAY BE ABLE TO
CONVINCE THEM OF THEIR SUITABILITY. AS I REPORTED IN REFTEL,
HE BROUGHT THESE UP HIMSELF IN MY JUNE 20 TALK.
