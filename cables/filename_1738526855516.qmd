2. FOLLOWING BIOGRAPHIC DATA ARE PROVIDED ON MEMBERS OF
BOLIVIAN DELEGATION. DELEGATION CHIEF MEDEIROS IS ONE OF
BOLIVIA'S MOST DISTINGUISHED FORMER DIPLOMATS, HAVING
SERVED IN A VARIETY OF DIPLOMATIC ASSIGNEMENTS FROM 1938-1952,
AND AGAIN FROM 1964 TO 1969. BORN INTO A PROMINENT SUCRE
FAMILY ON OCTOBER 15, 1913, MEDEIROS SUBSEQUENTLY OBTAINED HIS
LAW DEGREE IN LOCAL UNIVERSITY AND THEN DID POST-GRADUATE WORK
IN ARGENTINA BEFORE EMBARKING ON HIS DIPLOMATIC CAREER. FROM
1938 TO 1952 HE SERVED IN VARYING CAPACITIES WITHIN THE FOREIGN
MINISTRY AND IN BUENOS AIRES, SANTIAGO, PARIS, RIO DE JANEIRO,
THE UNITED NATIONS, GENEVA AND UNESCO. HIS LAST POST DURING
THIS PHASE OF HIS DIPLOMATIC LIFE WAS AS DIRECTOR OF POLITICAL
DEPARTMENT OF FOREIGN MINISTRY. MEDEIROS RETIRED INTO PRIVATE
LIFE DURING ENTIRE PERIOD OF MNR'S RULE IN BOLIVIA (1952-64),
SERVING AS PROFESSOR OF CIVIL LAW AT UNIVERSITY OF SUCRE,
PRESIDENT OF NATIONAL BANK OF BOLIVIA, LEGAL ADVISOR TO SUPREME
COURT AND VICE RECTOR OF UNIVERSITY OF SUCRE. FOLLOWING FALL
OF MNR, HE HEADED BOLIVIAN DELEGATION TO UNITED NATIONS, WAS
NAMED AMBASSADOR TO ARGENTINA IN MARCH 1965, AND SUBSEQUENTLY
RETURNED TO WORK IN FOREIGN MINISTRY FROM NOVEMBER 1968 UNTIL
HIS APPOINTMENT AS FOREIGN MINISTER BY PRESIDENT SILES SALINAS
ON MAY 5, 1969. MEDEIROS, A MEMBER OF PRESIDENT'S MODERATELY
RIGHT-WING SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY, HELD THIS POST UNTIL
OVERTHROW OF SILES IN SEPTEMBER 1969 WHEN HE AGAIN RETIRED
INTO PRIVATE LIFE. MEDEIROS SPEAKS FRENCH AND PORTUGUESE,
BUT IS NOT BELIEVED TO SPEAK ENGLISH. FURTHER DETAILS ON
HIS CAREER MAY BE FOUND IN EMBASSY FS-405 REPORT OF MAY 16,
1969. IN EMBASSY'S VIEW, MEDEIROS' CHIEF ROLE AT CARACAS IS
LIKELY TO BE THAT OF A DISTINGUISHED FIGUREHEAD, AND HE IS
UNLIKELY TO BE PRESENT THROUGH ENTIRE TWO-MONTH CONFERENCE.
MEDEIROS' LONG ABSENCE FROM ACTIVE DIPLOMACY AND HIS PERSONAL
LACK OF FAMILIARITY WITH LOS ISSUES WILL FORCE HIM TO RELY
HEAVILY ON TREDINNICK, WHO WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY PROVE TO BE
LEADING BOLIVIAN NEGOTIATOR ON KEY POINTS AT ISSUE.


3. FELIPE TREDINNICK WAS BORN ON NOVEMBER 30, 1930 OF A
BOLIVIAN MOTHER AND AN ENGLISH FATHER. HE HOLDS LAW DEGREE
FROM UNIVERSITY OF BRAZIL AND DOCTORATE IN INTERNATIONAL LAW
FROM UNIVERSITY OF MADRID. HE CURRENTLY IS PLANNING TO PUBLISH






 01 OF 02 010309Z


HIS 500-PAGE DOCTORAL THESIS: "LAW OF THE SEA AND MARITIME
FRONTIERS," IN SPAIN DURING 1975. TREDINNICK'S PREVIOUS KIPLO-
MATIC POSTS SINCE JOINING THE FOREIGN MINISTRY IN 1964 HAVE IN-
CLUDED MINISTER-COUNSELOR IN BRASILIA AND MADRID, CHIEF OF DELE-
GATION TO 1974 LANDLOCKED NATIONS CONFERENCE IN KAMPALA AND CHIEF
OF DELEGATION TO GROUP OF 77 LOS CONFERENCE IN NAIROBI. HE IS
ALSO A PROFESSOR OF INTERNATIONAL LAW AT SAN ANDRES UNIVERSITY
IN LA PAZ, AND ATTENDS CLASSES AT PRESTIGIOUS SCHOOL OF HIGHER




                    

                       

MILITARY STUDIES. TREDINNICK IS FORMER MEMBER OF
FSB AND WAS EXILED TO BRAZIL BY MNR FROM EARLY 1950'S
TO 1964 FOR HIS POLITICAL VIEWS; HE IS STILL PRO-FSB
AND VIOLENTLY ANTI-MNR IN HIS POLITICS. HE SPEAKS
PORTUGUESE AND A SMALL AMOUNT OF ENGLISH.


4. IN RECENT EXTENSIVE CONTACTS WITH TREDINNICK, EMBASSY
OFFICERS HAVE FOUND HIM TO BE SERIOUS, DEDICATED OFFICIAL
WITH WIDE KNOWLEDGE OF LOS ISSUES. HE HAS BEEN OPEN AND
FRIENDLY IN ALL OF THESE CONTACTS, AND APPEARS TO HAVE
HIGHLY FAVORABLE ORIENTATION TOWARD UNITED STATES.
TREDINNICK STATES THAT MANY OF HIS FAMILY RELATIVES LIVE
IN US, WHERE THEY HOLD ANNUAL REUNION IN WILKES-BARRE,
PENNSYLVANIA; HE HIMSELF EXPRESSES GREAT INTEREST IN POSSI-
BILITY OF VISITING US AT EARLIEST OPPORTUNITY. TREDINNICK'S
ATTITUDES TOWARD BRAZIL ALSO QUITE FAVORABLE, IN VIEW OF
FACT THAT HIS WIFE IS BRAZILIAN; HE ALSO FEELS FROM HIS OWN
EXPERIENCE IN BRAZIL THAT BRAZILIANS MAKE GOOD DIPLOMATS
AND ARE FLEXIBLE ENOUGH TO MAKE NEGOTIATION POSSIBLE OVER
POINTS OF DIFFERENCE. FROM HIS RECENT EXPERIENCES AT KAMPALA
AND NAIROBI, TREDINNICK CARRIED AWAY STRONGLY NEGATIVE RE-
ACTION TO PERUVIAN AND CHILEAN DIPLOMATS, WHOM HE CHARACTERIZES
AS LACKING ANY BARGAINING FLEXIBILITY AND FREEDOM TO NEGOTIATE.
