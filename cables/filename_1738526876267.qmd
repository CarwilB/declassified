# DEPARTMENT OF STATE TELEGRAM
**UNCLASSIFIED**

1. THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF STRUCTURAL REFORMS (CONARE),
WHICH IS TO STUDY A SERIES OF PROPOSALS FOR FUNDAMENTAL
CHANGES IN BOLIVIA'S POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS, WAS SWORN
INTO OFFICE BY PRESIDENT BANZER ON JULY 30. CABINET MINISTERS,
POLITICAL PARTY LEADERS AND THE JOINT COMMAND OF THE ARMED
FORCES WERE PRESENT AT THE CEREMONY, WHICH MARKS THE FIRST


STAGE IN A PROCESS OF "CONSTITUIONALIZATION" SCHEDULED
TO TERMINATE WITH THE INAUGURATION OF A NEW PRESIDENT IN
DECEMBER 1975. IN IS SPEECH, BANZER NOTED THAT HIS GOVERNMENT
SEEKS TO CREATE THE CONDITIONS WHICH WILL PERMIT THE ARMED
FORCES TO RETURN TO THEIR BARRACKS, FOLLOWING TEN YEARS
OF MILITARY RULE. AT THE SAME, TIME, HOWEVER, THE PRESIDENT






 012206Z


NOTED T AT THE MILITARY WILL "OBSERVE AND GUARANTEE"




                      

                   

THE TRANSITION PROCESS TO CIVILIAN RULE, WHILE SUBSEQUENTLY
RETAINING ITS ROLE AS THE "TRUE POWER FACTOR" IN BOLIVIAN
SOCIETY.


2. THE THIRTY-MAN COUNCIL, -9 OF WHOSE MEMBERS TOOK OFFICE ON
JULY 30, WILL NOW COMMENCE AN INTENSIVE PERIOD OF STUDY OF
DIFFERING REFORM PROPOSALS. RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE COUNCIL
MUST BE PRESENTED TO THE GOB BY JANUARY 23, 1975, WHEN
CONARE'S MANDATE EXIIRES; THESE PROPOSALS WILL THEN BE
STUDIED, AND POSSIBLY MODIFIED, BY THE GOVERNMENT, PRIOR
TO THEIR PRESENTATION TO THE PUBLIC IN A NATIONWIDE
REFERENDUM ON MARCH 23, 1975. ACCORDING TO THE INTERNAL
RULES OF PROCEDURE ADOPTED BY CONARE IN ITS FIRST MEETING,
ALL MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL WILL WORK FULL-TIME ON THEIR
OFFICIAL DUTIES, FOR WHICH THEY WILL RECEIVE A SALARY
FROM THE GOB. MOST OF CONARE'S WORK WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED
IN COMMITTEES AND STUDY GROUPS; WHEN THE COUNCIL
MEETS IN PLENARY SESSION, AN ATTEMPT WILL BE MADE TO ACHIEVE
"CONSENSUS" ON EACH SUBJECT TO BE DEBATED, AND NO VOTES
WILL BE TAKEN.


3. COMMENT: AS ORIGINALLY CONCEIVED BY THE BANZER GOVERNMENT,
CONARE WAS TO BE COMPOSED OF FOUR REPRESENTATIVES FROM EACH
OF THE GOVERNMENT PARTIES (MNR, FSB AND FUERZAS REVOLUCIONARIAS
BARRIENTISTAS), CAMPESINOS AND THE ARMED FORCES, TOGETHER
WITH 10 DISTINGUISHED PROFESSIONALS WHO WOULD PROVIDE THE
COUNCIL WITH TECHNICAL EXPERTISE. HOWEVER, CONARE PRESIDENT
EDWIN TAPIA, SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE PRESIDENCY AND LEADER
OF THE FRB, HAS ENCOUNTERED SERIOUS DIFFICULTIES IN ASSEMBLING
THE COUNCIL'S MEMBERSHIP. IN THE WAKE OF THE OUTRIGHT
REFUSAL BY ALL OPPOSITION PARTIES TO PARTICIPATE IN THE
COUNCIL'S DELIBERATIONS, PLUS THE DECISION OF THE ARMED
FORCES NOT TO BE OFFICIALLY REPRESENTED ON THE COUNCIL,
CONARE IS NOW COMPOSED OF THE FOLLOWING GROUPS OF CITIZENS:
THREE DELEGATES EACH FROM THE MNR, FSB AND FRB; ONE
REPRESENTATIVE FROM EACH OF THE NINE DEPARTMENTS OF BOLIVIA:
SIX REPRESENTATIVES FROM NON-POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS (LABOR,
BUSINESS AND CAMIESINO ORGANIZATIONS) AND SIX IROFESSIONALS.


4. CONARE'S MEMBERSHIP REFLECTS THE GOB'S DIFFICULTY IN






 012206Z


ATTRACTING PROMINENT POLITICAL NAMES TO THE COUNCIL. NO
OPPOSITION POLITICIANS ARE PRESENT ON THE COUNCIL, WHILE
THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PRO-GOVERNMENT PARTIES ARE LESSER
POLITICAL LIGHTS, FEW OF WHOM ARE WILL-KNOWN IN BOLIVIAN


POLITICAL CIRCLES. CAMIESINO AND LABOR DELEGATES TO THE
COUNCIL ALSO APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN CHOSEN MORE FOR THEIR




                   

                 

SUBSERVIENCE TO THE GOB'S WISHES THAN FOR ANY ABILITY
TO SPEAK FOR THE CONSTITUENCIES WHICH THEY NOMINALLY REPRESENT.
THE MOST NOTABLE COMMON CHARACTERISTIC OF THE COUNCIL'S
TWENTY-NINE MEMBERS IS THEIR UNUSUALLY HIGH EDUCATIONAL
LEVEL; 8 OF THE 29 ARE SUFFICIENTLY WELL-EDUCATED TO PREFACE
THEIR NAMES WITH THE HONORARY TITLE OF DOCTOR. ALSO,
SOME TEN OF THE COUNCIL'S MEMBERS HAVE RECEIVED LEGAL
TRAINING.


5. THE COUNCIL WILL BE COMILETED WHEN A FURTHER LABOR
REPRESENTATIVE IS CHOSEN; IF THE MINE WORKERS' FEDERATION
REJECTS THE POSITION OFFERED TO IT, THE LAST SEAT ON THE
COUNCIL WILL GO TO A REPRESENTATIVE OF EITHER THE RAILWAY
OR PETROLEUM WORKERS. A COMPLETE LIST OF THE COUNCIL WILL
FOLLOW SHORTLY BY AIRGRAM.
STEDMAN
