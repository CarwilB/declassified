# DEPARTMENT OF STATE TELEGRAM
**UNCLASSIFIED**

1. I reviewed structure and substance of Mexico City Foreign Ministers meeting with Dr. Marcelo Ostria, Director General of the Bolivian Foreign Ministry's Division of International Political Affairs. I covered the same ground that I did with the Foreign Minister on Feb. 12 but in more detail. Ostria took notes and was pleased to receive the information which he indicated he would use to guide the Foreign Minister's conduct and substantive conversations in Mexico.
2. Ostria said Bolivia understands that it will not play a significant role in the Mexico City Conference, given the power of others and the aggressiveness of a few. He expressed a great interest in having the conference arrive at a consensus that aid providers give preference to assistance to the poorer countries in the region. He feels this is not a bilateral issue in its totality and thus can be raised in a multilateral meeting.
3. As to bilateral matters, Ostria noted that the U.S. and Bolivia have no specific problems, that relations are excellent and that if any minor matters needed to be discussed bilaterally, it is the policy of the Bolivian Government to raise them with the Embassy here in La Paz.
4. Ostria then briefly touched on a personal idea of his which is long-range achievement of a satisfactory access to the sea by Bolivia based on improving relations with Chile. He said in confidence that the Ministry has an indication that the Chilean Foreign Minister may take the initiative in Mexico to meet with Foreign Minister Guzman to attempt to set the stage for improvement in Bolivian/Chilean relations. Ostria said it is hoped that over time this could be converted into some tangible settlement of Bolivia's long felt need for a seacoast. He noted another personal idea that some time in the future one or two of the larger countries in the region might wish to lend good offices to assist Chile, Peru and Bolivia in reaching some satisfactory accord.
5. Ostria is a bright, articulate, friendly career Bolivian diplomat with whom the Embassy has had close and effective working relations for some time. In our view, he will be the key member of the Bolivian delegation.
