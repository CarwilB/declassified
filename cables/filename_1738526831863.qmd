# DEPARTMENT OF STATE TELEGRAM
**UNCLASSIFIED**

1. On March 19 I handed text of following Aide Memoire to Acting President General Guzman in the Presidential Palace:

"The Department of State has informed the Embassy that it has carefully reviewed the Government of Bolivia's request for financial assistance for the reconstruction of flood damage. The Department has expressed the view that there should be first an assessment of the flood damage and the requirements for reconstruction, and that this analysis be conducted with the assistance of representatives of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Inter-American Development Bank, as well as the Agency for International Development. The Department suggests that the Government of Bolivia consider requesting perhaps through the auspices of CIAP, the multilateral agencies to undertake a joint survey. In any event, the United States is willing to provide experts from AID Washington to assist the Government of Bolivia in this assessment.

"After the assessment of damage and of reconstruction requirements is completed, the Department believes that it could form the basis for a Bolivian Government request for assistance to the financial agencies located in Washington. The United States believes that the IBRD and IDB have resource availabilities sufficient to assist in Bolivian reconstruction without serious distortion of their programs elsewhere. This would not be the case with AID assistance. For AID, any significant financing for reconstruction might necessitate a special authorization and appropriation from the United States Congress. Given the history of Congressional responses to such requests, it appears that the only way AID would be able to help in the near term in reconstruction efforts would be within the existing funding levels. This would mean that assistance for flood reconstruction would have to be subtracted from planned development lending programs. A decision on this would appropriately await the completion of the assessment. Furthermore, the implementation plans for AID loans planned in FY 75 could be designed to have maximum effect in support of reconstruction efforts. The Government of Bolivia may also wish to consider the feasibility of reprogramming local currency generated by prior PL-480 sales and program loans to cover a portion of the reconstruction effort. The United States will actively support Bolivian requests for the multilateral assessment of damage and to examine with the Government of Bolivia the most feasible means of financing those requirements, including the multilateral agencies."

2. In addition to the text of the Aide Memoire, I explained to the Acting President that the Department viewed the reconstruction matter in two phases--the first the assessment and the second the financing. It was our preference that both be conducted by multilateral cooperation. Nonetheless, we were prepared to assist in the assessment without the World Bank and the IDB if that were the GOB desire. I explained the limitations on AID financial assistance in line with the two State telegrams under reference. I noted that press information in La Paz suggested that the Bolivians were already preparing a letter to President McNamara of the IBRD asking for reconstruction assistance for railroads and roads. This, I noted, would be a natural area for the IBRD particularly since they were already contemplating additional financial help for railroads. I noted that Bolivia might well take advantage of a high level IDB mission soon to visit La Paz and the Santiago IDB meeting to discuss with IDB participation in the assessment and subsequent financing of reconstruction effort.

3. Acting President Guzman thanked me for the reply from Washington to the Bolivian request for reconstruction assistance and indicated that he would discuss our conversation and the Aide Memoire with President Banzer as soon as he could after Banzer's return to La Paz, scheduled for 6 P.M., March 19. He noted that dividing the operation into two parts made sense and that a survey of the damage and requirements was obviously a logical first step. He indicated his understanding of the limitations on AID financial participation but expressed the hope that even though greater reliance might be placed on IBRD and IDB, some USG financial participation be provided in the reconstruction effort which was so important to the country's economy.
