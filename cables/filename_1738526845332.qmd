# DEPARTMENT OF STATE TELEGRAM
**UNCLASSIFIED**

::: {.cable-meta}
:::


1. IN ACCORDANCE WITH INSTRUCTIONS IN REFTEL, I RAISED WITH
MINISTER MINES LEMA ON MAY 6 THE SUGGESTION THAT GOB ARRANGE FOR
ARBITRATION, THIRD PARTY PROCEEDINGS, NEGOTIATION, OR OTHER
ACCEPTABLE MEANS TO SETTLE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FRANK TYE AND THE
GOB ABOUT IMPC/EMBOSA. I POINTED OUT TO MINISTER LEMA THAT USG
DOES NOT TAKE ANY POSITION ON THE MERITS OF THE CASE. I NOTED
THAT USG DOES NOT WISH TO BECOME DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN PROCEEDINGS
BETWEEN THE PARTIES. I TOLD THE MINISTER THAT TYE HAD PRESENTED
HIS ARGUMENTS TO THE DEPARTMENT WHICH HAD MADE A REVIEW OF THE
CASE TO DETERMINE HOW WE COULD HELP RESOLVE THE PROBLEM. I
STRESSED THAT THE DEPARTMENT BELIEVES THAT THE APPROACH WE ARE
SUGGESTING SEEMS TO US TO OFFER BEST PROSPECT FOR SOLUTION.


2. MINISTER LEMA RESPONDED THAT BOLIVIAN AUTHORITIES, PRIOR TO
EMBOSA LIQUIDATION, HAD CONSIDERED ARBITRATION PURSUANT TO
ARTICLE 41 OF THE STATUTES BUT IDEA WAS DISCARDED AS NOT FEASIBLE
WAY OF SETTLING DISAGREEMENT WITH TYE. COMPANY WAS THEN LIQUIDATED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATUTES. GOB BELIEVES LIQUIDATION AND ALL






 072056Z


MATTERS PERTAINING THERETO WERE CORRECTLY HANDLED, LEGALLY AND




                       

                   

TECHNICALLY. FURTHERMORE, GOB BELIEVES FRANK TYE ADEQUATELY
COMPENSATED BY PRESENT BOLIVIAN REGIME BY CASH PAYMENT US$1.4 MILLION
FOR IMPC EXPROPRIATION. IN VIEW OF FOREGOING, MINISTER SAID IT
WOULD NOT BE POLITICALLY ACCEPTABLE NOR LEGALLY APPROPRIATE FOR
GOB TO ORGANIZE NOW AN ARBITRATION OR OTHER PROCEEDINGS FOR MATTER
WHICH IT FEELS HAS BEEN FAIRLY AND CORRECTLY HANDLED. MINISTER
THEN SAID GOB IS ABOUT TO PRESENT "DENUNCIA" AGAINST TYE FOR
US$400,000 WHICH GOB ASSERTS TYE OWES COMIBOL FOR OPERATING COSTS
IN THE PERIOD OF MARCH TO NOVEMBER 1973. MINISTER LEMA ALSO SAID
THAT HE HAD HEARD THROUGH FRIENDS THAT FRANK TYE HAD SAID HE
WOULD TAKE CERTAIN LEGAL ACTIONS IN US AGAINST BOLIVIA. MINISTER
OBSERVED THAT FOR GOB TO ENTER INTO SOME FORM OF ARBITRATION
AFTER REPORTED THREATS OF ACTION AGAINST GOB WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE
TO EXPLAIN SATISFACTORILY IN BOLIVIA. HE ALSO SAID THAT HE ALSO
BELIEVES THAT IT WOULD NOT BE IN US INTEREST FOR THE GOB TO ARRANGE
FOR ARBITRATION BECAUSE MOST BOLIVIANS WOULD ASSUME THAT PROCEED-
INGS OPENED UNDER PRESSURE BY USG AND WOULD REACT NEGATIVELY.
THE MINISTER CONCLUDED BY STATING THAT SINCE IT GENERALLY BELIEVED
THAT TYE ONLY WISHES TO EXTRACT MORE MONEY FROM BOLIVIA AND
SINCE GOVERNMENT ABOUT TO PRESENT CLAIM AGAINST HIM, ARBITRATION
NOT ACCEPTABLE TO GOB.


3. I CHOSE TO RAISE MATTER WITH MINISTER OF MINES BECAUSE HE IS
THE RESPONSIBLE OFFICIAL IN THE MINING SECTOR AND TO HAVE GONE
AROUND HIM ON SUCH A SENSITIVE MATTER WOULD HAVE BEEN DETRIMENTAL
TO OUR OTHER INTERESTS IN THE MINING FIELD. FURTHERMORE, RECENT
RUMORS ARE THAT LEMA MIGHT BECOME MINISTER OF ENERGY AND HYDRO-
CARBONS, A SECTOR OF INCREASING IMPORTANCE TO US. ALSO I DO
NOT BELIEVE THAT LEMA HOLDS DIFFERENT VIEWS ABOUT TYE AND IMPC
THAN, ACCORDING TO REPORTS, ARE HELD BY PRESIDENT BANZER, EX-
MANAGER OF COMIBOL GENERAL MIRANDA, EX-PRESIDENT EMBOSA BOARD
MANUEL MERCADO (NOW PRESIDENT OF CENTRAL BANK), MINISTER FINANCE
QUIROGA, AND EX-MINISTER SECRETARY GENERAL OF PRESIDENCY GUIDO
VALLE.


4. IN PRELIMINARY PLEASANTRIES WITH THE MINISTER, I MENTIONED
THAT I PLANNED TRIP TO US SOON AND HOPED TO HAVE CONSULTATIONS
IN DEPARTMENT OF STATE. AS I WAS DEPARTING FROM HIS OFFICE,
MINISTER LEMA SUGGESTED THAT I TAKE ADVANTAGE OF CONSULTATIONS TO
EXPLAIN TO SENIOR US OFFICIALS THE REALITIES OF THE PRESENT






 072056Z


BOLIVIAN SITUATION WHICH MAKE ARBITRATION OF THIS MATTER UN-
ACCEPTABLE. HE NOTED THAT BANZER REGIME RECORD OF AMIACABLE
RESOLUTION OF INVESTMENT DISPUTES SHOULD BE BORNE IN MIND.


5. I DID NOT REQUEST, NOR DID THE MINISTER OFFER, ANY INFORMATION
ABOUT QUID PRO QUOS IN FORM OF TAX CREDIT RELATING GIBRALTAR
HUARI-HUARI VENTURE WITH IMPC/EMBOSA CLAIM. I WOULD LIKETO NOTE
THOUGH THAT IN PARAGRAPH 4, THE FYI SECTION, OF REFTEL, IT IS




                   

                   

STATED THAT "TYE INDICATED HE MIGHT BE WILLING TO DROP IMPC/EMBOSA
CLAIM IF GOB WOULD NOT EXERCISE ITS STOCK OPTION ON GIBRALTAR
HUARI-HUARI MINING VENTURE WHICH EXPIRED MARCH 1." WE HAVE COPY
OF TYE'S LETTER DATED JANUARY 21, 1974, ADDRESSED TO MARSHALL
WRIGHT, THEN ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE OF CONGRESSIONAL
RELATIONS, IN WHICH TYE WROTE "WE WOULD BE WILLING TO ACQUIESCE
IN SUCH (COMIBOL) OWNERSHIP AND RELINQUISH OUR CLAIM WITH RESPECT
THERETO IF THE BOLIVIAN GOVERNMENT WILL RELINQUISH ITS OPTION,
GRANTED TO IT IN THE NATIONALIZATION SETTLEMENT, TO ACQUIRE
51 PERCENT OF GIBRALTAR HUARI-HUARI MINE CORPORATION."
SINCE GOB HAS DROPPED ITS OPTION, I HAD THOUGHT TYE WOULD,
ACCORDING TO HIS OWN LETTER, DROP EMBOSA CLAIM.


6. I HOPE THAT THERE WILL BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THIS
MATTER FURTHER IN WASHINGTON DURING MY CONSULTATION.
STEDMAN
