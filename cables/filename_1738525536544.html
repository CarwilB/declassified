<li><p><strong>Following is a transcript</strong> of the 11/2/79 noon press briefing given by Tom Reston:</p>
<p>Q. Tom, on another subject, what does the United States think of the direction in which things are moving in Bolivia?</p>
<p>A. Where?</p>
<p>Q. Bolivia – it’s a country –</p>
<p>Q. Land-locked Bolivia. (LAUGHTER)</p>
<p>A. Yes. I do have something I want to say about this. The forced change of government, of course, was by non-constitutional means, and last night’s closing of the Congress was further disruption of the constitutional process. I said yesterday that we would deplore any disruption of the constitutional process there, and I stand on that. It is regrettable that this major step backwards occurred in the Bolivian people’s heartening advance during the last two years toward representative government and respect for human rights.</p>
<p>Q. You alluded yesterday to a review of US-Bolivian relations if the coup in fact succeeded. Can you say that without qualification today?</p>
<p>A. Oh, yes, I can say that without qualification. That review continues; but on the basis of what we learned yesterday and what apparently has taken place on the ground, I want to announce that in response to the situation there the United States has suspended its assistance programs with Bolivia. We will continue to review all aspects of our relations.</p>
<p>Q. What was the size of that assistance program?</p>
<p>A. Military assistance recently has been running at approximately $6 million per year; planned development assistance for fiscal year 1980, including Food for Peace, is approximately $50 million. Out of that $50 million, the Food for Peace amount is $28.5 million.</p>
<p>Q. You’re not suspending that, are you?</p>
<p>A. I have got an expert in the back there. Are we suspending the total $50 million?</p>
<p>Mr.&nbsp;Taylor: Yes. Mr.&nbsp;Reston: We are suspending – including the Food for Peace. It has all been suspended.</p>
<p>Q. Is the Ambassador expected to come home?</p>
<p>A. No.&nbsp;Paul Boeker is going to remain on the scene to report about the evolving situation.</p>
<p>Q. What is his last name?</p>
<p>A. B-O-E-K-E-R is his last name.</p>
<p>Q. What is his first name, Paul?</p>
<p>A. Paul.</p>
<p>Q. In other words, the US action appears to mean that you have now made up your mind about this regime, you don’t like it, and you are going to do what you can to discourage it.</p>
<p>A. I said that we deplore it; we regret it. We continue to review the totality of our relationship with Bolivia; and on the basis of what we learned yesterday about what has taken place, we have taken the concrete actions which I have just announced.</p>
<p>Q. Why are you cutting the Food for Peace, which goes to needy people?</p>
<p>A. The question?</p>
<p>A. The question is, why are we cutting the Food for Peace program? I think I have suggested the reasons which lie behind the announcement which I have just made.</p>
<p>Q. In view of this famous luncheon on October 23 at the Embassy, to which this Colonel Natusch was invited but didn’t go, does the Secretary consider this as not only a setback for US policy but to his own prestige?</p>
<p>A. I think what I want to say about that lunch which we had down there is that the United States does not pretend to control events in every other country in the world.</p>
<p>Q. That’s for sure. (LAUGHTER)</p>
<p>A. At that lunch, the Secretary made the views of the United States known to those at the luncheon. We have stated our deep concern over the departure from constitutional processes, but it is the Bolivians themselves, in the last analysis, who will decide what happens in their country.</p>
<p>Q. Let me follow that up? The American Secretary of State, at the American Embassy, invites four former Presidents, all the Army chiefs, and talks about democracy, and about a week later there is a coup. Is this a setback for US policy and for the Secretary personally?</p>
<p>A. I think what it really – I think the tone of my statement would indicate that we perhaps believe it is a setback for constitutional processes in Bolivia.</p>
<p>Q. Tom, can you tell us whether we have talked to any other Latin American governments about this or are we attempting to coordinate activities in order to bring pressure on Bolivia?</p>
<p>A. I think I took that question yesterday, but I didn’t get an answer to it. I’ll check again, today.</p>
<p>Q. Tom, do you know what the timing would be on the aid cutoff – like would weapons shipments be stopped or training programs be terminated? Or is there something you could reverse if events down there changed in a fairly short time?</p>
<p>A. What I show here is the suspension of these programs, and I assume that that means that they will be frozen.</p>
<p>Q. Tom, could I just follow up on that and one other question?</p>
<p>A. Yes.</p>
<p>Q. When you talk about this total of $56 million, has any part of that already gone down? Are we talking about the entire $56 million being suspended or has most of it already –</p>
<p>A. It’s $50 million.</p>
<p>Q. It’s $50 million plus $6 million military, right?</p>
<p>A. Oh, yes. I’m sorry. You’re absolutely right.</p>
<p>Q. How much is Food for Peace?</p>
<p>A. $28.5 is Food for Peace, economic assistance is $50 million, military is –</p>
<p>Q. What about –</p>
<p>Q. Wait a minute. Let’s get the answer first.</p>
<p>A. The $50 million is planned development assistance for fiscal year ’80, which began October 1 of this year. I will take the question as to what amount has already been sent down there, what amount is in the pipeline, and what amount remains to be sent.</p>
<p>Q. And, of course, military is what?</p>
<p>A. I will get a precise figure for fiscal year ’80 and will break it out in the same manner.</p>
<p>Q. Do you have last year’s?</p>
<p>Q. Then, I just wanted to ask another question: Yesterday, I believe you were under the impression that this Colonel was of the right-wing persuasion, but there have also been stories that –</p>
<p>A. I didn’t say anything about him.</p>
<p>Q. I’m sorry. Well, maybe I saw that somewhere else. Does the State Department have any evaluation yet of where on the political spectrum this gentleman stands?</p>
<p>A. I have some biographical information about him; I don’t have anything to offer about his ideological persuasions except from his actions. He obviously has a particular view of politics.</p>
<p>Q. Not a convicted democrat. (LAUGHTER)</p>
<p>A. Do you want the biographical information?</p>
<p>Q. No, but what I would like, though, is some sense of the whole – and I’d appreciate it if you would take the question – not just of his ideological persuasion, but who the forces are behind him. Do you have any sense of that?</p>
<p>A. Well, let’s see what I can get for you on that.</p>
<p>Q. Do you know if Bolivia receives Development Bank assistance, and if so, will the United States act in those forums to cut aid to Bolivia, which is where it counts, usually?</p>
<p>A. I’ll take that question.</p>
<p>Q. I wondered if pipeline aid was also being suspended – in other words, ships at sea, are they being turned back?</p>
<p>A. We’ll try to find the answer to that question.</p>
<p>Q. Stuff in the FY ’79 budget, sometimes that stuff, you know, even though the year is ended, is still on the way.</p>
<p>A. I’ve said that we are suspending our aid here. We are not going to make up our minds about these things depending on which fiscal year the budgetary cycle is in. I will take the question about whether stuff which is on its way is going down there, but I don’t think we are going to make up our minds about this as to whether it was done before or after October 1.</p>
<p>Q. Is your announcement here the first word to them or have they been formally notified through the Embassy?</p>
<p>A. We have formally notified them through the Embassy.</p>
<p>Q. Tom, you pushed aside what I think was a very legitimate question a couple of minutes ago. It has often been our practice in the past, for example, in dealing with the Somoza government in Nicaragua, not to suspend what we call humanitarian aid that benefited the people of a country. We have expressed a lot of concern about famine in other parts of the world despite our disapproval of governments there. Why is it that we are including Food for Peace and other humanitarian programs in this suspension?</p>
<p>A. Let me take that question and see if I can get you a more elaborate rationale beyond what has obviously happened in the last 24 hours.</p>
<p>Q. Do you consider this government consolidated already?</p>
<p>A. The situation last night in Bolivia appeared to be calm. There does not seem to be active military opposition to the new Bolivian regime. There does, however, seem to be some opposition among civilian groups. Ex-President Paz Estenssoro, the leader of the National Revolutionary Movement, has expressed his opposition as have several other leading political figures and organizations in Bolivia, including former President and Commander of the Armed Forces General David Padilla, and including the principal labor leadership in Bolivia.</p>
<p>Q. Tom, a follow up?</p>
<p>A. Yes, go ahead and follow up.</p>
<p>Q. Democracy in Bolivia was installed in a regional context in which many countries were supporting this process. Why aren’t you able to tell us what kind of contacts you are having with the Andean countries and is there any role for the coup by Brazil and Argentina?</p>
<p>A. Is there any role for the coup?</p>
<p>Q. Yes. Did Argentina and Brazil play any role supporting the coup?</p>
<p>A. I have nothing about purported roles by Argentina or Brazil. As to your other question about, have we been in touch with the Andean Pact, I don’t see any reason why we shouldn’t be able to provide that answer to you, and I would hope that the bureaucratic wheels would start to turn and get an answer to your very legitimate question.</p>
<p>Q. Tom, I know you do not deal with questions of recognition of changes of government, but in view of the fact that there is substantial special civilian opposition, including former President Guevara meeting with a rump session of the National Assembly, do you now recognize Colonel Natusch as the head of the government of Bolivia? Or are you considering that judgment not to be makeable at this point?</p>
<p>A. I can’t make that judgment from this podium here. I think we have our Ambassador on the ground there, who is reporting on what is very clearly an evolving situation. We are reviewing the totality of our relationships with Bolivia, and that means as well, obviously, we are reviewing the nature of our diplomatic relationship with Bolivia.</p>
<p>Q. Tom, do you have anything for comparative purposes of what aid actually went to Bolivia last year?</p>
<p>A. I can get that for you, sure. Q. Tom, you mentioned that Argentina and Brazil are not involved. What about Chile?</p>
<p>A. I mentioned that Argentina and –</p>
<p>Q. And Brazil that there is no apparent role.</p>
<p>A. I said that I didn’t have anything to offer about that.</p>
<p>Q. What about Chile?</p>
<p>A. I really have nothing that I can offer on the nature of the Chilean relationship, if any.</p>
<p>Q. You said that you were examining the nature of our diplomatic relations with Bolivia?</p>
<p>A. I said, yesterday, that we were reviewing the totality of our relationship with Bolivia –</p>
<p>Q. Yes, but we specifically –</p>
<p>A. – and “totality” obviously would include everything, including diplomatic –</p>
<p>Q. Wait a minute, don’t go away –</p>
<p>A. Oh, I am going to have to go away pretty soon, as a matter of fact.</p>
<p>Q. Yes, I know. Yesterday, we excluded diplomatic because your policy used to be that you don’t recognize governments, you recognize countries.</p>
<p>A. Yes.</p>
<p>Q. Is there a question whether – is there a possibility you are saying the United States is considering whether or not to maintain diplomatic relations with Bolivia? Is that what you are saying?</p>
<p>A. I would not want you to write that, frankly, I don’t think that is very –</p>
<p>Q. Well, would they –</p>
<p>A. I don’t think that is where I am trying to take you here.</p>
<p>Q. But you said you were reviewing it.</p>
<p>A. I said we were reviewing our relationship with Bolivia in light of the developments which have taken place there over the last 36 hours or so.</p>
<p>Q. That is not what you said yesterday.</p>
<p>A. Yes, that’s what I said yesterday.</p>
<p>Q. Today you said “diplomatic relationships.”</p>
<p>A. Then I was asked the question: “Well, what does that mean? How much of your relationship?” And I said we were reviewing the totality of our relationship.</p>
<p>Q. Right.</p>
<p>A. Now, diplomatic relations can involve a great many things. I was asked the question earlier in the briefing today as to whether we were going to recall our Ambassador there. I said, no, we’re not going to recall our Ambassador there. That is part of diplomatic relations. We are going to leave the Ambassador there to report on the situation as it developed. I have nothing to offer you.</p>
<p>Q. O.K.</p>
<p>A. Absolutely nothing, one way or the other, about the status or our present diplomatic relations with Bolivia.</p>
<p>Q. Well, you probably want to stay on Bolivia for a while, don’t you?</p>
<p>A. I don’t, but they do. (LAUGHTER)</p>
<p>Q. Tom, do you have any information whether any part of the Bolivian Armed Forces are in touch with the civilian opposition to this coup? In other words, is there some hope of reversal here, or what?</p>
<p>A. I really can’t answer that question because I don’t know the answer. But I have a more official posture to put on it, which is that I know of no military unit in the country which is in opposition at the present time –</p>
<p>Q. Except the Commander-in-Chief.</p>
<p>A. – to the Colonel’s people.</p>
<p>Q. Tom, you took the question about talks with Andean countries. If, when checking, you discovered that the United States has not consulted with Argentina and Brazil, would this indicate that you are thinking that these two countries are playing with the coup?</p>
<p>A. No, I don’t think so. But I will try to check and see whether we have been in touch with the others, as well, about it. We have done a good deal of work over recent months with members of the Andean Pact qua Andean Pact. We worked closely with them to try to help resolve the Nicaraguan situation. The Secretary was in Quito for the installation of the new Ecuadorean President, and he met with the Andean Pact as members of the Andean Pact then. Again at the OAS meeting, we met with them as members of the Andean Pact. Therefore, it seems to me logical in that framework, that we would have been consulting with members of the Andean Pact about what has happened within one of their own countries.</p>
<p>Q. Tom, General Banzer was the other man who didn’t come to lunch last week, I gather. Do you regard him as being involved or behind this coup?</p>
<p>A. I really don’t have anything to offer on that.</p>
<p>Q. Can you take that question?</p>
<p>A. Yes, let me find out what we think the General is up to.</p>
<p>Q. By taking this drastic action, including suspension of food aid – a step which has not even taken with respect to Cambodia where a holocaust is going on – are you trying to promote the restoration of civilian rule? Are you trying to undercut this government?</p>
<p>A. Who runs Bolivia is a matter for the Bolivians to decide. We do not control that. But we, like Bolivia, are a sovereign nation: and we have the right to take actions which are within our control.</p>
<p>Q. That doesn’t answer the question. What is your ultimate objective by taking this drastic action?</p>
<p>A. I don’t want to stand here and give you a tote list of what the ultimate objectives of the United States are. When the Secretary was in La Paz, he made very, very clear to the Bolivians the preference of the United States for democratic processes.</p>
<p>Q. Tom, let me follow that up, please. That’s a general question. Can you recall any other time when the US has cut off food – aid – when it was suspended?</p>
<p>Q. Chile.</p>
<p>Q. When this administration has done it.</p>
<p>A. I will take that question.</p>
<p>Q. Yes, in fact it might help if you could, if you listed instances, because I know there have been precedents – but I don’t know which countries. They were small countries.</p>
<p>A. I will take the question.</p>
<p>Q. Yes, I want to follow up with this question: When you were listing the times recently when you have dealt with the Andean Pact as the Andean Pact, they have tended to be times when the Andean Pact has not followed the preferable US policy in given situations. I would like to ask a philosophical question: If the new government indeed is oriented along the lines of, for instance, Argentina, do you think that they would play a role in tending to be more supportive of the kind of initiatives that the Andean Pact has rebuffed that Secretary Vance made in the instances you mentioned?</p>
<p>A. Oh, Laura, I think that is a speculative question.</p>
<p>Q. I can rephrase it less diplomatically.</p>
<p>A. I am sure you can, Laura.</p>
<p>Q. Tom, I would like to ask you a couple of questions about Cuba.</p>
<p>Q. Still on Bolivia – can you say whether any US officials are meeting or talking with members of the former Guevara government or other opponents of the coup in Bolivia, and are encouraging them to take some steps to restore the democratic processes there?</p>
<p>A. I think you can assume that Ambassador Boeker and his staff at the Embassy in La Paz are in touch with a number of Bolivian political figures to discuss with them the situation. I am not going to detail for you what the Ambassador and his staff precisely might be saying.</p>
<p>Q. Opposition? Including the opposition?</p>
<p>A. A number of Bolivian political leaders.</p>
<p>Q. Tom, there is one inconsistency here that I just can’t reconcile in my mind. You describe this as an evolving situation. You have got the Ambassador talking to opposition political figures. And yet you have taken such a decisive act as to cut off, or suspend all aid. Doesn’t that decision imply that you regard this as pretty much a fait accompli? I don’t see how it can be evolving and while it is evolving you take such a decisive step.</p>
<p>A. I don’t necessarily see any inconsistency in that.</p>
<p>Q. Well, let’s put it this way: do you see this action as being a factor in the evolution of the situation?</p>
<p>A. Well, we will see about that, won’t we? Because –</p>
<p>Q. Is it the contention of this government that it should be a factor in the evolution of the situation?</p>
<p>A. I think that you are just going to have to use your own judgment on that. And as to whether it will turn out to be a factor, that is something that only the future will tell.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Subsequent to the above verbatim exchange</strong>, the Department posted a correction as to which economic assistance was being suspended.</p>
<p>A. The correction is as follows: We are suspending military and economic assistance while we follow developments in Bolivia and review our programs in the light of the developments. We do not intend to suspend, or cut off, Title II PL 480 or other humanitarian assistance.</p>
<p>B. At the same time this correction was posted, the press was given the following breakdown of economic assistance:</p>
<table class="table">
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th style="text-align: left;"></th>
<th style="text-align: left;">FY 1979</th>
<th style="text-align: left;">FY 1980</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">Development Assistance Loans</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">$20.0 Million</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">$14.0 Million</td>

<tr class="even">

<p>C. Department spokesman subsequently further clarified that Title III assistance was also not affected by the review.</p></li>
