1. **Summary:** The first day of the conference proceeded smoothly, with adoption of the agenda, appointment of the board, designation of working committees and selection of their boards, opening speeches by ECLA Executive Secretary Enrique Iglesias, and by Bolivia's Planning Minister Gary Prado Salmon. An otherwise harmonious opening day was marred only by remarks in Prado's statement concerning loss of its coastal land and the development constraints which stem from that loss, and his accusing the US of "economic aggression" directed towards Bolivia through sales of tin from our strategic stockpile.

2. The first two agenda items concerned election of officers, and adoption of the agenda and organization of work of the 18th Session. Without objection, the make-up of the board was established as follows: Chairman-Gary Prado (Bolivia), 1st Vice Chairman-Victor Barrelo (Mexico), 2nd Vice Chairman-Ludwing Zuiverloon (Suriname), Rapporteur-Wilburg Castro (Costa Rica). The provisional agenda, issued March 6, was adopted with a modification calling for a separate committee to be formed to deal with water-related activities. Accordingly, three committees were established. Committee I will address agenda items III and IV, convening respectively, the economic and social development and external economic relations of Latin America, and cooperation among developing countries and regions. Committee II will deal with agenda item five, activities of the ECLA system since the 17th Session and program of work for the period 1979-81. Committee III, as stated, will consider regional coordination in actions related to water. Boards were selected for all committees but Committee III, where it was agreed committee members would select their own officers. Committee I officers were selected as follows: Chairman-Ecuador, 1st Vice Chairman-Cuba, 2nd Vice Chairman-Argentina, Rapporteur-Venezuela. Committee II officers are: Chairman-Peru, 1st Vice Chairman-Jamaica, 2nd Vice Chairman-Uruguay, Rapporteur-Brazil.

3. Iglesias' brief opening remarks called for a strong ECLA role in galvanizing a unified Latin American view of the appropriate development strategy as the Third Development Decade approaches. He pointed out that the world economic situation is fraught with uncertainties, and that enhanced cooperation among the developing countries would moderate some of those problems. He urged particular attention to agenda item four, which he hoped would result in a strong follow-on to the Buenos Aires Plan of Action for Technical Cooperation among Developing Countries (TCDC), established in September, 1978.

4. As host to the session, Bolivia's Planning Minister Prado gave the keynote address which began with a litany on the stages of Bolivian economic and social development since the country's independence. He claimed that Bolivia's status as one of the region's poorest countries would be different had what he said was its richest land and access to the sea not been plundered (by Chile in the 1879 War of the Pacific). Probably forewarned of Prado's remarks, the Chilean delegation did not attend the inaugural session. Prado noted that Bolivia's economic growth rate did not begin to equal those of its neighbors until the 1960s and 70s, although he decried the fact that the benefits of that growth were unequally distributed. The task of Bolivia, and the rest of Latin America, in the next decade, he said, was to emphasize equity, a consideration overlooked in the past two decades when the pursuit of growth dominated development strategy. The obligation to move away from the strategy which encouraged the misuse of scarce capital and luxury consumption, to one encouraging mass employment and widening of consumption throughout the population, is one which rests primarily with individual governments, Prado averred. But he also mentioned the role which external capital and the TNCs have to play in equitable development. He felt TNCs had not always operated in the best interests of developing countries; claiming that the region's mineral resources were underexplored, he blamed that on TNCs which traditionally controlled investments in the extractive industries. In order to realize Latin America's mineral potential, Prado proposed the creation of a regional fund to finance investments in the minerals sector, and urged ECLA to undertake a study to determine the feasibility of such a fund, and how it might coordinate its activities with other international institutions. (Comment: We expect the Bolivian delegation to introduce a resolution to this effect in Committee I. End comment.) In the context of the importance of minerals to Bolivia's economy, Prado castigated the US for what he termed economic aggression in manipulating the world prices of commodities, alluding to an expected sale from US tin stocks. Since Bolivia is moving towards democratic elections and is trying to improve the welfare of its poor, Prado wondered out loud how US actions on tin can be reconciled with avowed US espousal of human rights and democracy.
