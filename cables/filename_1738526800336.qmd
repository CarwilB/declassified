# DEPARTMENT OF STATE TELEGRAM
**UNCLASSIFIED**

::: {.cable-meta}
:::


1. I SENSE A NEED FOR A COMPREHENSIVE NEWS STORY ON THE PL-480
SITUATION AS IT AFFECTS ALL RECIPIENT COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD.
THERE IS A GROWING FEELING WHICH HAS BEEN EXPRESSED TO MANY
OFFICERS AT THE MISSION THAT THE DIFFICULTIES THAT BOLIVIA IS
ENCOUNTERING IN ACQUIRING NEW AGREEMENTS FOR PL-480 IS THE
RESULT OF A FUNDAMENTAL SHIFT IN US POLICY FROM HUMANITARIAN
ASSISTANCE TO COMMERCIAL SALES. THERE IS ALSO EQUAL MISUNDER-
STANDING THAT THIS SHIFT IN POLICY MAY BE APPLIED ONLY TO
BOLIVIA. MEMBERS OF THIS MISSION HAVE DONE A GOOD JOB IN
ATTEMPTING TO EXPLAIN THAT THE PL-480 PROGRAM IS BASED ON THE
EXISTENCE OF EXCESS COMMODITIES AND THAT IN SPITE OF LARGE
US PRODUCTION, THE COMMERCIAL SALES PRECLUDE PL-480 PROGRAMS ON
THE SCALE OF PREVIOUS YEARS. WE HAVE ALSO ATTEMPTED TO EXPLAIN
THAT THIS AFFECTS BOLIVIA BUT IS NOT POINTED AT BOLIVIA. I DO
NOT THINK THAT WE ARE GETTING OUR MESSAGE ACROSS AND KNOW THAT THERE
ARE MANY PEOPLE WITH WHOM WE DO NOT HAVE DIRECT CONTACT WHO MIS-
UNDERSTAND RECENT COMMODITY DEVELOPMENTS. I AM NOT INTER-
ESTED IN A STORY TAILORMADE FOR BOLIVIA; RATHER IT SEEMS TO ME THAT
THERE MUST BE IN COUNTRIES OTHER THAN THIS ONE, SERIOUS QUESTIONS






 061614Z


AND DOUBTS BEING RAISED WHICH COULD WELL BE PUT TO REST BY A




                        

                  

SKILLFUL PRESENTATION OF THE FACTS SURROUNDING CHANGES IN OUR
ABILITY TO CARRY ON PL-480 OF THE MAGNITUDE OF PREVIOUS YEARS.


2. THE PUBLIC AFFAIRS OFFICER OF THIS POST HAS REQUESTED USIA
TO DEVELOP A STORY ALONG THESE LINES WHICH REPORTS THAT IT HAS
ENCOUNTERED NEGATIVE REACTIONS FROM AID, STATE AND AGRICULTURE.
THE ASSERTION IS THAT TRYING TO EXPLAIN THE SITUATION MIGHT DO
MORE HARM THAN GOOD. THIS IS A POSITION WHICH NO ONE HERE AT
THIS MISSION IS ABLE TO UNDERSTAND. IT HAS ALSO BEEN ASSERTED THAT
A STORY ABOUT THE PL-480 SITUATION COULD DO SOMETHING WITH THE
MARKET WHICH IS EQUALLY DIFFICULT FOR US HERE TO FATHOM



3. THE PURPOSE OF THIS MESSAGE IS TO ATTEMPT TO ELICIT A FAVOR-
ABLE RESPONSE FROM WASHINGTON AGENCIES TO OVERCOME BY A
WELL DEVELOPED STORY THE HALF TRUTHS AND MISINFORMATION
ALREADY APPEARING IN US AND FOREIGN NEWSPAPERS. WE HERE RECOGNIZE
THAT BOLIVIA HAS HAD GOOD FORTUNE WITHIN THE PL-480 ALLOCATIONS
BUT THIS HEIGHTENS RATHER THAN LESSENS THE NEED FOR A WELL
REASONED STORY FOR WORLDWIDE CONSUMPTION. I CAN VISUALIZE THE
INCLUSION IN SUCH A STORY OF SOME OF THE SIGNIFICANT ACCOMPLISH-
MENTS OF PL-480 PROGRAMS BASED ON THE USE OF LOCAL CURRENCY.
INCLUDED IN SUCH SUCH INFORMATION MIGHT BE A PRESENTATION OF
PROGRAMS WHICH HAVE HAD SUCCESS IN RAISING DOMESTIC PRODUCTION
OF FOODSTUFFS.


4. IF IT IS NOT POSSIBLE FOR USIA TO PUT OUT SUCH A STORY,
COULD WE NOT COMMISSION ON A CONTRACT A SKILLED JOURNALIST TO
PRODUCE SUCH A STORY POSSIBLY FOR PUBLICATION IN AN ACCEPTABLE
US PUBLICATION. THIS THEN COULD BE REPRODUCED IN THE LOCAL MEDIA
FOR SUBSTANTIAL BENEFIT IN ACHIEVING UNDERSTANDING OF OUR
SITUATION.
STEDMAN
