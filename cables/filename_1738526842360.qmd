# DEPARTMENT OF STATE TELEGRAM
**UNCLASSIFIED**

1. PRESIDENT BANZER MADE THE FOLLOWING POINTS DURING COURTESY CALL
ON APRIL 23 BY COUNTRY DIRECTOR KARKASHIAN AND AMBASSADOR:


A. THE GOB AND HE, PERSONALLY, ARE DEEPLY GRATEFUL TO THE
USG FOR CONTINUING U.S. ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE, WITH SPECIAL REGARD
FOR THOSE LOANS MADE FOR EMERGENCY ACTIVITIES SHORTLY AFTER
HE ASSUMED POWER. THE GOVERNMENT WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO HAVE THE
U.S. CONSIDER AN ADDITIONAL PADES LOAN SINCE IT HAS PROVEN TO BE
AN EFFECTIVE DEVELOPMENT TOOL AND A POSITIVE FACTOR FOR STABILITY
IN THE COUNTRY.


B. THE GOVERNMENT IS SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING OUR RECENT OFFER OF
$4 MILLION FMS CREDIT AND WILL COMMUNICATE ITS RESPONSE PROMPTLY.
THE GOB MAY WISH TO USE THE LINE OF CREDIT FOR TRANSPORT AIRCRAFT,
HEAVY CONSTRUCTION MACHINERY, AND OTHER HARDWARE WHICH MIGHT HAVE A
PRODUCTIVE PURPOSE.


C. THE GOVERNMENT IS PLEASED TO LEARN THAT A TEAM COMPOSED OF






 241827Z


IDB, IBRD, AND AID TECHNICANS WILL SOON ARRIVE IN BOLIVIA TO ASSESS




                      

                   

FLOOD DAMAGE. BASED ON THAT ASSESSMENT, THE PRESIDENT SAID, HE
HOPED THAT PROJECTS MIGHT BE DEVELOPED TO PREVENT FUTURE FLOODING AND
TO RELOCATE AND HOUSE REFUGEES


D. THE PRESIDENT WAS PLEASED TO LEARN THAT USG TECHNICIANS WILL
ARRIVE SOON TO STUDY THE POSSIBILITIES OF SUBSTITUTION OF ALTERNATIVE
CROPS FOR COCA. HE SUGGESTED EXAMINATION OF POSSIBLE COURSES OF ACTION


SUCH AS PURCHASE OF COCA LEAF PRODUCTION AND ITS DESTRUCTION,
OR INCENTIVE PAYMENTS DIRECTLY TO FARMERS TO PRODUCE OTHER
COMMODITIES.


E. PRESIDENT EXPRESSED HIS CONTINUED INTEREST IN PROMPT DELIVERY
OF MILITARY EQUIPMENT FOR THE TIPOS IN ACCORDANCE WITH UNDERSTANDINGS
REACHED WITH US. THE AMBASSADOR DESCRIBED THE CURRENT DELIVERY
FORECASTS AND REPORTED ON THE ARRIVAL OF SIGNIFICANT MILITARY ITEMS
IN RECENT WEEKS AND WITHIN THE COMING MONTH. PRESIDENT SEEMED
PLEASED BUT REPEATED HIS FIRM DESIRE THAT THE TIPOS BE BROUGHT UP
TO STRENGTH AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE TO RAISE THE MORALE OF THE TROOPS
AND TO CREATE A DISSUASIVE FORCE TO INHIBIT THE OUTBREAK OF INTERNAL
DISORDER.


2. COUNTRY DIRECTOR KARKASHIAN EXPLAINED THE OPERATIONS OF AN FMS
CREDIT, NOTED THE INCREASING DIFFICULTIES OF ACQUIRING MAP GRANT AID
AND POINTED OUT THE DESIRABILITY OF BOLIVIA'S UTILIZATION OF FMS
CREDIT.
KARKASHIAN EXPRESSED THE APPRECIATION OF WASHINGTON
AUTHORITIES FOR BOLIVIA'S CONTINUED EFFECTIVE COOPERATION IN
COMBATTING DRUG TRAFFICKING. WHILE STATING THE U.S. POLICY OF
CONTINUED SUPPORT AND ASSISTANCE FOR THE BOLIVIAN GOVERNMENT, HE
CAREFULLY AVOIDED SPECIFIC COMMITMENTS FOR LOANS FOR CROP
SUBSTITUTION,
NEW PADES OPEATIONS, AND FOR RECONSTRUCTION.


3. IN THE DISCUSSION OF FMS CREDIT, PRESIDENT BANZER SAID THAT IT
WAS HIS HOPE THAT COFADENA WOULD BECOME AN EFFECTIVE INSTRUMENT FOR
ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT. HE SAID IT SHOULD CONCENTRATE ITS
ACTIVITIES RATHER THAN CONTINUING AS AT PRESENT TO AGGRESSIVELY ENTER
A WIDE RANGE OF ACTIVITIES. HE EXPRESSED HIS HOPE THAT EXTERNAL
CREDITS MIGHT FACILITATE CONFADENA ACQUISITION OF PRODUCTIVE






 241827Z


EQUIPMENT
AND THAT ITS FUTURE PROFITS COULD THEN BE TURNED TO BENEFIT THE
LOT OF THE COMMON SOLDIER WITH BETTER HOUSING AND MEDICAL CARE.
IN THIS WAY HE HOPES TO REDUCE THE DEMANDS ON THE TREASURY FOR
MILITARY
EXPENDITURES AND BURDENING THE NATION WITH CREDITS FOR NON-PRODUCTIVE
MILITARY EQUIPMENT.




                   

                  

4. PRESIDENT BANZER TOLD KARKASHIAN THAT HE REGRETTED HAVING TO POST-
PONE
THE STATE VISIT TO THE U.S. SCHEDULED FOR LAST FALL, BUT DOMESTIC
POLITICAL
FACTORS ARISING FROM ECONOMIC MEASURES PRECLUDED HIS DEPARTING THE
COUNTRY. THE PRESIDENT SAID HE HOPED THAT HE BE ABLE TO MAKE THE TRIP
SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE AT PRESIDENT NIXON'S AND HIS MUTUAL
CONVENIENCE. KARKASHIAN RESPONDED THAT THIS WAS ALSO THE DESIRE OF
THE
USG AS SET FORTH IN PRESIDENT NIXON'S LETTER TO PRESIDENT BANZER.
