# DEPARTMENT OF STATE TELEGRAM
**UNCLASSIFIED**

1. The effective world-side advertising campaign of the Anglo-Bolivian Land and Cattle Co. (ABLC) deluged US with inquiries about the company. In July 1978 we completed our investigation and sent our report to USDOC and SECSTATE. Our efforts have continued but with virtually no new information. We have found it extremely difficult to obtain information about this company.

2. The Anglo-Bolivian Land and Cattle Company is the international sales department of Varangian Investments Ltda. We do not know in which country Varangian Investments is registered. According to a document sent to the Santa Cruz, Bolivia Prefect, Varangian Investments was founded about 1964 and has operated throughout Central America and the Caribbean, where the firm has engaged in agriculture, cattle, and real estate activities. Varangian Investments appears to be related to the Inter-American Finance Corp. in London. Amembassy London has been unsuccessful in its efforts to contact this firm for additional information (REFTEL E). According to our information, neither Varangian Investments nor the Anglo-Bolivian Land and Cattle Company are registered in Bolivia. These two companies apparently formed three Bolivian companies, Santa Teresita Ltda., El Parnaso Ltda., and Los Milagros Ltda., to acquire and develop land near Santa Cruz.

3. Mr. James M. Rodengen was and may still be the general manager of Santa Teresita Ltda., the only active one of the three Bolivian companies associated with ABLC. Mr. Rodengen worked for seven years as the Varangian Investments director of sales for the Central America region before Varangian Investments transferred him to Santa Cruz. His address was the following: Casilla 3746, Santa Cruz, Bolivia; Phone: 30022 - Telex: CABINA PUBLICA BX 7600 ANBOL.

4. Mr. Alan D. Hutchinson is an attorney who is the managing director of the Anglo-Bolivian Land and Cattle Co. He is also director of the Inter-American Finance Corp. Although apparently residing in London, he travels to Santa Cruz frequently.

5. Through Santa Teresita Ltda., the Anglo-Bolivian Land and Cattle Co. purchased three parcels of contiguous land totaling 11,000 hectares near Santa Cruz during the last quarter of 1977. Supposedly, each piece of property that is for sale is well-marked and has an access road. Sales prices are about US$ 34 to US$ 40 per hectare. These prices are considered to be above the area's current market prices. Property values are not expected to reach current sales prices for two or three more years. Therefore, the firm's offer appears to be a highly speculative one. Anglo-Bolivian Land and Cattle Co. guarantees clear title to the property. Money may be placed in escrow until title is received.

6. The following mail addresses for Anglo-Bolivian Land and Cattle Co. have appeared in the sales literature which we have seen:
A. Box 58, 15 Central St., Woodstock, Vermont 05091
B. Barclays Bank Building, P.O. Box 265, Grand Cayman, British West Indies
C. Schiphol Airport East, P.O. Box 7766, Amsterdam, The Netherlands
USDOC found the Vermont mail is merely forwarded to Mr. Hutchinson in London (REFTEL B). Also, AmConsul Amsterdam reports that the Amsterdam P.O. Box is used only by an air transport firm (REFTEL D).

7. On December 26, 1978 the Bank of America branch in Santa Cruz told US that ABLC is not a client but that they are supported financially by Inter-American Finance Company domiciled in Grand Cayman and that any financial figures on both companies could be available through the Barclay's International Bank in the same city.

8. The Bolivian Consejo Nacional de Reforma Agraria makes no guarantee as to the soundness of this investment and recommends that persons interested in purchasing lots visit the property first to verify the company's assertions and to find out the real cost of the property.

9. An Undersecretary in the Ministry of Agriculture told US in February 1979 that the GOB had virtually no information about ABLC. He suggested that the new tracts of land now being sold by ABLC are public lands. (The initial three tracts were sold out). He was going to investigate this matter and report to US, but so far, he has no new information.
