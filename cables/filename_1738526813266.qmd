# DEPARTMENT OF STATE TELEGRAM
**UNCLASSIFIED**

1. Bolivian Foreign Minister, General Guzman, has released to the press the letter from Secretary Kissinger delivered Feb. 28 by the ambassador and announced that the secretary took under consideration a Bolivian request for financial assistance for reconstruction of flood damage. In his press conference remarks, Guzman said that he had also presented to Secretary Kissinger the Bolivian case for special preference for loans because of its state of underdevelopment compounded by its lack of a sea-coast. He said too that he asked the secretary for special "non-reimbursable" financing for the substitution of coca production. These remarks, he said, were well received by the U.S. Secretary of State, although no formal response given.

2. The minister sought with Secretary Kissinger. He stated that Latin Americans, especially Bolivians, believe they will receive answers to propositions put to the secretary at the April OAS meeting in Atlanta, if not before.

3. Ample press coverage was given to the minister's press conference. U.S. assistance was featured as if it were assured. An editorial in Diario the following day credits the U.S. with its generosity in coming to Bolivia's assistance with reconstruction loans.

4. Unless Department instructs us to the contrary, we shall attempt to steer any requests to us for financial aid for flood damage reconstruction toward IBRD and IDB as well as to AID. We also believe the GOB should be encouraged to present its needs in this regard to the CIAP in the country review scheduled for next month. The request for a crop substitution credit will be reviewed with Perry Shankle, ARA Bureau Narcotics Advisor, now in La Paz.

5. We shall be most appreciative for any guidance Dept can give us. Stedman
