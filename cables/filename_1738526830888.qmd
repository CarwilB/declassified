# DEPARTMENT OF STATE TELEGRAM
**UNCLASSIFIED**

1. Dr. Jorge Del Villar, member of Law of Sea Department of Foreign Ministry, told Emboff March 15 that GOB is beginning intensive preparations for Caracas Conference in effort to avoid improvisation which characterized previous Bolivian participation in UN-sponsored LOS meetings. Bolivians are currently working on Kampala Landlocked States Conference, where Bolivia will be represented by Dr. Felipe Treidinnick Abasto, Minister-Counsellor of the Bolivian Embassy in Madrid, Spain. Dr. Treidinnick is a career diplomat and lawyer who has specialized in question of Bolivia's right to an access to the sea.

2. According to Dr. Del Villar, Bolivia is hopeful that Kampala conferees will agree to a unified position which will enable these nations to bargain as a bloc with other participants in forthcoming Caracas Conference. Bolivia already has carried out extensive consultations with Paraguay, and feels confident that the Paraguayans will go along with Bolivia's initiatives at Kampala meeting. Bolivia's major initiative at latter conference will be call for establishment of an international organization to control exploitation of sub-surface sea resources, and apportion proceeds from these resources among both coastal and landlocked states. Del Villar expressed great interest in learning details of U.S. Government's position on this issue.

3. Regarding the 200-mile limit question, Del Villar stated that Bolivia continues to oppose position adopted on this issue by four of its neighbors (Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Peru). Although he did not rule out possibility of bilateral bargaining on this issue between Bolivia and its neighbors, in return for concessions to Bolivia's desire for a share in sub-surface sea resources, Del Villar said that Bolivian position on the territorial sea at present conforms much more closely to U.S. position on that issue.

4. **Comment:** This Embassy would appreciate receiving full information on any common positions adopted at Kampala Meeting of Landlocked States. At same time, Embassy also wishes to receive guidance on U.S. position re: exploitation of sub-surface sea resources, and Department's views on degree of potential compatibility between our posture and that adopted by GOB, as expressed in paragraph 2 above.
