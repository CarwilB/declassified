# DEPARTMENT OF STATE TELEGRAM
**UNCLASSIFIED**

2. **Summary:** According to IMF team leader Caiola, negotiations between the Fund and the GOB are on track and final action by the IMF should take place by mid-December. Caiola believes that the Central Bank's reserve position is sufficiently good, providing recent credits from Latin American Central Banks are rolled over, for such a schedule to be feasible. End summary.

3. Marcelo Caiola, the leader of the IMF team currently negotiating with the GOB, and Jorge Sol Perez, the Fund's local representative, briefed me Friday afternoon on the current state of the negotiations. Caiola indicated that the negotiations were proceeding well, although they were slowed somewhat by difficulties in obtaining some key data. The appointment this week of Jose Justiniano as Central Bank President is viewed by Caiola as a very positive development.

4. The present schedule is for Caiola to assemble his analysis and recommendations by September 26 so that they can be discussed by GOB and Fund officials during the IMF/IBRD annual meeting in Belgrade. Agreement on the steps to be taken by the GOB should be reached at the meeting or shortly thereafter. The GOB will then begin to implement the measures, especially those concerning the exchange rate, during November. Caiola will prepare his documentation and submit it to the IMF Board at that time. The Board should take action by December 15.

5. The financial package Caiola has in mind would include: (A) an Extended Fund Facility drawing of $240 to $280 million disbursed as follows—25 percent in December 1979, 50 percent in calendar 1980 and 25 percent in calendar 1981; (B) a credit of about $250 million probably over five years with two years grace from a syndicate led by Citibank to cover $200 million owed to commercial banks with a little extra for the Central Bank's reserves; (C) a $30 to $40 million loan by the Fundo Andino; and (D) possibly a $30 to $40 million program loan from the IBRD.

6. Although the Central Bank's reserve position continues to weaken, Caiola is confident that with the rollover for 180 days of the $140 million borrowed recently (for 90 days) from the Central Banks of Argentina, Brazil and Venezuela, the drawdown of $50 million lines of credit with commercial banks which the GOB has not yet touched, and a tight credit policy, the timetable outlined in paragraph 5 will be feasible.
