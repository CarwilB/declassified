# DEPARTMENT OF STATE TELEGRAM
**UNCLASSIFIED**

1. (C - ENTIRE TEXT)

2. Our problem in justifying IMET is that it is by nature a long-term program directed at subtle changes in attitude that neither appear clearly and suddenly nor demonstrably as the result of our investment. The best I can offer from Bolivia is the apparent costs of cumulative under investment in IMET over many years.

3. Through the 70s our investment in IMET in Bolivia has been a continual succession of reductions, to the point where our impact on the younger generation of officers is probably marginal. Even more important, this generation of officers has had its entire career up to August 1979 under military governments and has received its external training in Argentina, Brazil and Peru where the military also rules by some presumed natural right. This combination of factors has produced a group of officers who have no real comprehension of the role of the military in a democratic society and who are a glaring and dangerous anachronism in a society which has evolved toward a representative, constitutional government tenaciously defended by all sectors of the civilian society.

4. In the first half of November this dichotomy between part of the military and the civilian population led to a bloodbath in which a group of arrogant, rightist officers completely out of touch with their own country tried unsuccessfully to impose a military dictatorship on a society that would not have it. Probably 500 unarmed civilians were killed and the Bolivian military was disgraced in a tragic coup that should not have been—from anyone's perspective.

5. One of the common characteristics in the group of middle-aged rightist officers who led the coup and in the younger officers who followed them was that they had virtually all had no training in the US, whereas US training or close ties were common among the more democratic-minded officers which the coup leaders pushed aside. If all goes as expected now, the middle-aged rightists and some of the more brutal younger officers involved will now be purged or pushed aside to unimportant assignments. But a very serious attitudinal crisis remains within the Bolivian military.

6. While IMET or the shortage of it has obviously not been a principal factor in this recent tragedy, I do believe the very low level of the younger officer's exposure to the US and US attitudes and the role and doctrine of the US military, combined with the dominance of Argentine training in particular, has been a factor behind the prevalence of arrogant, anachronistic, and dangerous attitudes on the military and politics among younger Bolivian officers. Among an older generation, many of whom spent cherished months at Fort Benning or in other US schools, there is a clear softer edge on their political views, a more humble concept of the military and a more rationalist approach to its role in society.

7. The following responds to the questions posed in paragraph 2, REFTEL, which are applicable to our situation and not addressed above:

A. The IMET program serves the dual purposes of (1) introducing Bolivian officers to US military doctrine, tactics and training methods, and (2) providing Bolivian officers an in-depth real life exposure to US institutional ideals and the role of the military within the context of American democracy.

B. As a result of the more comprehensive and expansive security assistance programs of the past, I and key members of my staff have been afforded excellent access to the military officials of the Bolivian armed forces. In almost all cases, the results of these direct contacts have been more congenial and fruitful where the contacted official has attended US military training in Panama or, especially, the US.
