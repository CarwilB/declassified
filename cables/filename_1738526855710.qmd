# DEPARTMENT OF STATE TELEGRAM
**UNCLASSIFIED**

1. SUMMARY: SINCE THE REOPENING OF THE UNIVERSITIES IN 1972,
PERSISTENT CRITICISM HAS BEEN VOICED OF THE LARGE BUREAURACY
CREATED BY THE NEW FUNDAMENTAL LAW OF THE BOLVIAN UNIVERSITY,
THE INCREASED ROLE OF POLITICAL PARTIES IN THE UNVERSITY AND
THE FAILURE TO HOLD ELECTIONS FOR STUDENT LEADERS. THESE DIS-
SATISFACTIONS, SHARED BY STUDENTS, PROFESSORS AND MANY OUTSIDE
OBSERVERS OF THE UNIVERSITY SCENE, WERE CRYSTALLIZED BY THE
RESIGNATION MAY 9 OF THE RECTOR OF SAN ANDRES UNIVERSITY IN
LA PAZ. SUBSEQUENTLY, A CHAIN REACTION F APPOINTMENTS TO
AND RESIGNATIONS FROM THE RECTORSHIP, COUPLED WITH STUDENT
PROTEST MEETINGS, LED TO THE CLOSING OF THE COUNTRY'S LARGEST
UNIVERSITY ON MAY 21. ALTHOUGH SAN ANDRES UNIVERSITY IS NOW
SCHEDULED TO REOPEN ON JUNE 3, THE POWER STRUGGLE BETWEEN
COMPETING POLITICAL FACTIONS WITHIN THE UNIVERSIT SYSTEM
HAS ONLY JUST BEGUN, AND IS LIKELY TO INTENSIFY OVER THE
NEXT FEW MONTHS. END SUMMARY.


2. THE SURFACE CALM IN BOLIVIA'S UNIVERSITIES OVER THE PAST






 01 OF 02 311516Z


TWO YEARS HAS HIDDEN A GROWING MEASURE OF DISCONTENT WITH




                       

                    

SOME OF THE CHANGES IN THE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM WHICH WERE
BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE 1972 FUNDAMENTAL LAW OF THE BOLIVIAN
UNIVERSITY. THIS LAW RESTRICTED UNIVERSITY AUTONOMY TO THE
REALM OF ADMINISTRATIVE AND ACADEMIC AFFAIRS, WHILE CREATING
A NEW NATIONAL COUNCIL OF HIGHER EDUCATION (CNES) TO OVERSEE
THE OPERATION OF THE NATION'S NINE UNIVERSITIES. OTHER ASPECTS
OF THE POST-1971 UNIVERSITY SCENE WHICH HAVE BRED DISSATIS-
FACTION AMONG STUDENTS, PROFESSORS AND MANY OUTSIDE OBSERVERS
INCLUDE THE INCREASED ROLE OF POLITICAL PARTIES IN THE UNIVER-
SITIES, A RAPID GROWTH IN THE NUMBER OF SUPERNUMERARIES
OCCUPYING ADMINISTRATIVE POSTS WITHIN THE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM
AND THE FAILURE TO HOLD ELECTIONS FOR STUDENT LEADERS.


3. THE RESIGNATION OF RECTOR FELIPE HARTMANN OF SAN ANDRES
UNIVERSITY (UMSA) IN LA PAZ ON MAY 9, FOLLOWING A SERIES OF
CLASHES BETWEEN HARTMANN AND CNES OVER THE UNIVERSITY AUTONOMY
ISSUE, CRYSTALLLIZED MUCH OF THE EXISTING DISCONTENT OVER THE
FUNCTIONING OF THE BOLIVIAN UNIVERSITY SYSTEM. WITH HARTMANN'S
REPLACEMENT BY VICE RECTOR MARIO AGUILAR, A MEMBER OF THE
FALANGE PARTY, FSB MEMBERS WERE RAPIDLY NAMED TO A SERIES OF
HIGH-LEVEL ADMINISTRATIVE POSTS WITHIN THE UNIVERSITY.
THIS ATTEMPT TO GIVE A PARTISAN POLITICAL CAST TO THE
NATION'S LARGEST UNIVERSITY PROVOKED A THREAT FROM THE MNR
TO WITHDRAW ALL OF ITS ADMINISTRATIVE AND ACADEMIC PERSONNEL
FROM UMSA. FOLLOWING A SERIES OF HURRIED POLITICAL CONSUL-
TATIONS WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT, CHANGES IN THE COMPOSITION OF
CNES WERE ANNOUNCED ON MAY 15-16 WHEREBY AGUILAR JOINED THAT
BODY AND WAS REPLACED AS RECTOR OF UMSA BY COLONEL JOSE ZELAYA.
ZELAYA, A PROFESSOR OF GEOGRAPHY AND ENGINEERING, THUS BECAME
THE FIRST MILITARY OFFICER EVER TO HOLD THE POST OF RECTOR OF
SAN ANDRES UNIVERSITY.


4. STUDENT REACTION TO THE APPOINTMENT OF A MILITARY OFFICER
TO THIS POST WAS IMMEDIATE AND STRONGLY NEGATIVE. AT A PUBLIC
MEETING CALLED BY THE STUDENT-ELECTED INTER-FACULTY COMMITTEE
ON MAY 17, THE ASSEMBLED UMSA STUDENTS APPROVED RESOLUTIONS RE-
JECTING BOTH ZELAYS AND CNES, AND DECLARED A 24-HOUR STRIKE.
IN THE FACE OF STRONG OPPOSITION TO HIS NOMINATION, ZELAYA RE-
SIGNED THE RECTORSHIP ON MAY 19, AND WAS REPLACED ON THE FOLLOWING
DAY BY AGUILAR. STUDENT LEADERS NOW ATTEMPTED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE






 01 OF 02 311516Z


OF THE CONFUSED ATMOSPHERE AT UMSA BY CALLING A MEETING ON MAY 21,
AT WHICH THEY PLANNED TO DENOUNCE AGUILAR'S REAPPOINTMENT, CALL
FOR THE ELECTION OF RECTORS BY STUDENTS AND PROFESSORS, AND
APPROVE POLITICAL RESOLUTIONS IN FAVOR OF THE REOPENING OF THE
COB AND DECLARING VISITING BRAZILIAN PRESIDENT GEISEL PERSONA
NON GRATA. THIS MEETING WAS ABORTED BY A SQUAD OF
FALANGE YOUTH, ARMED WITH TEAR GAS AND REVOLVERS, WHO
CLEARED OUT THE SITE OF THE STUDENT ASSEMBLY IN A RAPID




                    

                       

COMMANDO-TYPE ACTION: SUBSEQUENT ATTEMPTS BY THE STUDENTS
TO REASSEMBLE WERE DISPERSED BY THE POLICE. IN THE WAKE
OF THESE EVENTS, INTER-FACULTY COMMITTEE LEADERS CALLED FOR
A 48-HOUR STRIKE, AND WERE SUPPORTED BY SYMPATHY STRIKES AT
THE CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY AND THE UNIVERSITIES OF COCHABAMBA
AND SUCRE. ON THE SAME DATE, MAY21, THE RECTOR OF UMSA RE-
SPONDED BY ANNOUNCING THE INDEFINITE CLOSURE OF SAN ANDRES
UNVERSITY.


5. THE IMPORTANCE OF ACHIEVING A POLITICAL SETTLEMENT TO THE
ONGOING UNIVERSITY CRISIS WAS IMPRESSED UPON THE GOVERNMENT
BY THE INVOLVEMENT OF NEW GROUPS IN THE CRISIS IN SUCCEEDING
DAYS. ON THE DAY OF THE UNIVERSITY'S CLOSURE, THE ARMED FORCES
ISSUED A JOINT STATEMENT SUPPORTING COLONEL ZELAYA'S ACTIONS
AND CALLING UPON ALL PARTIES TO THE DISPUTE TO REFLECT UPON THE
NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR ACTS: IN PARTICULAR, THE DOCU-
MENT MADE CLEAR THE "FIRM DECISION" OF THE MILITARY INSTITUTION
TO "CAUSE THE ESTABLISHED ORDER AND SUBMISSION TO THE PRINCIPLES
OF AUTHORITY AND DISCIPLINE TO BE RESPECTED." STATEMENTS BY
GROUPS OF PROFESSORS AND PARENTS OF UNIVERSITY STUDENTS CALLING
FOR THE REOPENING OF THE UNIVERSITY WERE SUPPORTED ON MAY 27
BY A COMBINED DECLARATIONOF SUCH KEY UNIONS AS THE MINERS,
BREWIN
