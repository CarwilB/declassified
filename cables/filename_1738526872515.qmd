# DEPARTMENT OF STATE TELEGRAM
**UNCLASSIFIED**

1. THE NEW ALL-MILITARY CABINET HAS NOT MET TOGETHER AS YET,
BUT ALREADY THERE IS SPECULATION THAT THE FOURTEEN MEMBERS
ARE DIVIDING INTO THREE OR FOUR CLIQUES, ONE OF WHICH,
HEADED BY COLONEL JUAN PATINO AYOROA, IS BASICALLY HOSTILE
TO PRESIDENT BANZER. THESE DIVISIONS, HOWEVER, APPEAR TO
RESULT FROM POLITICAL AMBITIONS AND PERSONAL LOYALTIES
RATHER THAN FROM ANY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN
POLITICAL VIEWS. THERE ARE NO SO-CALLED GENERATIONAL GROJP
OFFICERS IN THE CABINET, AND THE OVERALL PHILOSOPHICAL
CAST OF THE NEW GOB IS CONSERVATIVE. IT IS LIKELY TO PLAY A
CARETAKER ROLE IN THE VARIOUS MINISTRIES RATHER THAN ATTEMPT
TO LAUNCH BOLD NEW VENTURES.


2. PRESIDENT BANZER SHOULD HAVE LITTLE DIFFICULTY IN
EXERCISING HIS LEADERSHIP IN THIS CONTEXT AS LONG AS HE






 192214Z


MAINTAINS A DEGREE OF FLEXIBILITY IN HIS DEALINGS WITH THE




                      

                   

ALLEGED FACTIONS WITHIN THE CABINET AND THE HIGH COMMAND OF
THE ARMED FORCES. AT THE PRESENT TIME, IT APPEARS TO US THAT
BANZER WILL REMAIN IN OFFICE UNTIL SOME SUCCESSION PROCESS,
SUCH AS ELECTIONS, IS ARRANGED IN 1975. HE MIGHT BE PRESSURED
INTO RESIGNING IN FAVOR OF A MILITARY JUNTA NINETY DAYS
OR SO BEFORE ELECTIONS IN ORDER TO ADD TO THE PROSPECTS OF
GOVERNMENT IMPARTIALITY IN THE ELECTORAL PROCESS. SO LONG AS
BANZER AND HIS CABINET MANAGE WHAT IS NOW GENERALLY VIEWED
AS A GOVERNMENT OF TRANSITION, HE IS NOT LIKELY TO CONFRONT
ANY SERIOUS OR BROADLY BASED COUP ATTEMPT. HOWEVER, SHOULD
IT APPEAR THAT HIS PLANS TO MODIFY THE POLITICAL STRUCTURES
OF THE COUNTRY ARE A COVER TO STAY IN OFFICE, OR TO POSTPONE
ELECTIONS INDEFINITELY, HE WOULD RUN A GRAVE RISK OF BEING
THROWN OUT OF OFFICE.


3. THE PROCESS OF RECOMMENDING AND ADOPTING THESE POLITICAL
REFORMS IS IMPORTANT, THEREFORE, TO THE STABILITY OF THE
PRESENT GOVERNMENT. THERE IS ALREADY GRUMBLING OVER THE
NON-WORKING OF THE NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR STRUCTURAL REFORM,
AND ITS PREDECESSOR THE NATIONAL CONSULTATIVE COUNCIL(NEVER
FORMED, THOUGH ANNOUNCED IN EARLY APRIL), AND THE LENGTHY
TIME PERIOD GIVEN TO THE COUNCIL (180 DAYS) TO MAKE ITS
RECOMMENDATIONS. SOME PEOPLE ARE NOW SUGGESTING THAT IT
WOULD BE MORE DEMOCRATIC, MORE CONSTITUTIONAL AND MORE
CONDUCIVE TO POLITICAL TRANQUILITY, TO CALL FOR A CON-
STITUENT ASSEMBLY TO PROPOSE AND APPROVE CONSTITUTIONAL
REFORMS. THESE PEOPLE SUGGEST THAT THE NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR
STRUCTURAL REFORM SHOULD BE LIMITED TO PROPOSING THE RULES
FOR CONVENING A CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY, WHICH COULD THEN BE
CALLED WITHIN A MONTH OR SO. THERE IS ALSO TALK THAT WITHOUT
A BROAD POLITICAL AMNESTY AND FREEDOM TO CAMPAIGN POLITICALLY,
THE GOVERNMENT'S CREDIBILITY IN FORMING THE ALL-MILITARY
CABINET WILL BE SHOT FULL OF HOLES.


4. REPORTEDLY, THE SO-CALLED GENERATIONAL GROUP OF OFFICERS
LED BY GARY PRADO CONTINUES TO AGITATE FOR BANZER'S
REMOVAL AND FOR PROMPT GENERAL ELECTIONS, BUT THE BANZER
GOVERNMENT SHOULD HAVE A BREATHING SPELL NOW OF SEVERAL
WEEKS BEFORE THE OPPOSITION PRESSURES GROW TO DANGEROUS
PROPORTIONS. AS NOTED ABOVE, THESE PRESSURES NEED NOT GROW






 192214Z


UNDULY IF THE GOVERNMENT SHOWS SUFFICIENT SIGNS OF FORWARD
MOVEMENT LEADING TO A PROMISED GOVERNMENTAL SUCCESSION.


5. THE EMBASSY EXPECTS THAT THE PRESIDENT WILL USE AUGUST 6,
INDEPENDENCE DAY, AND AUGUST 7, ARMED FORCES DAY, TO MAKE
SOME MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENTS SURROUNDING THE TIME TABLE FOR
ELECTIONS AND PERSONNEL CHANGES (E.G., A SHAKE UP IN THE
MILITARY AND CHANGES IN THE MINISTRIES AT THE SUB-SECRETARY




                   

                 

LEVEL).


6. COMMENT: THE EMBASSY BELIEVES THAT THE FORMATION OF AN
ALL-MILITARY CABINET IF IT CARRIES OUT ITS STATED PURPOSE
OF GOVERNING DURING A TRANSITIONAL PERIOD LEADING TO
NATIONAL ELECTIONS NEXT YEAR SHOULD BENEFIT U.S. INTERESTS
IN BOLIVIA. POLITICAL TENSIONS HAVE BEEN LESSENED AND
DEMOCRATICALLY ORIENTED POLITICAL GROUPS SHOULD HAVE A
CHANCE TO RECOVER THEIR FOLLOWING AND GREATLY REDUCE THE
PROSPECTS OF A GOVERNMENTAL TAKE-OVER BY EXTREMIST ELEMENTS.
BEFORE THE FORMATION OF THE MILITARY CABINET AND THE ANNOUNCED
FORTHCOMING CONSTITUTIONALIZATION OF THE COUNTRY, THE ODDS
WERE RISING FOR A COUP BY JUNIOR MILITARY OFFICERS WHO MIGHT
HAVE BECOME RADICALIZED IN THEIR QUEST FOR SUPPORT.


7. THE ALL-MILITARY GOVERNMENT WILL ALMOST INEVITABLY LEAD TO
SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED MILITARY EXPENDITURES, PRINCIPALLY ON
PAY, BENEFITS AND ALLOWANCES SIDE. THE BOLIVIAN ARMED FORCES,
LIKE MOST OTHER SECTORS OF BOLIVIAN SOCIETY, ARE IN VERY
POOR SHAPE. TO THE EXTENT THAT BETTER PAY AND FACILITIES
HELP INSURE THE COHESIVENESS AND LOYALTY OF THE MILITARY
UNITS TO THE PRESENT GOB, THE PROSPECTS FOR POLITICAL
STABILITY ARE ENHANCED AND OUR OVERALL INTERESTS IN BOLIVIA
ADVANCED.
