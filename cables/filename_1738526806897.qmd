# DEPARTMENT OF STATE TELEGRAM
**UNCLASSIFIED**

1. Bolivian Foreign Minister Guzman received me late afternoon Feb. 12 for lengthy review foreign ministers meeting in Mexico. I handed him Secretary Kissinger's letter indicating that Secretary hoped by the letter to establish first personal contact with the Foreign Minister and to set the stage for the Mexico City meeting. The Foreign Minister was extremely pleased to receive a signed letter from the Secretary and since he does not understand English I had a chance to translate for him with brief explanations of points during the translation. I went over very carefully with the Foreign Minister our preferred format for the Mexico City meeting and followed with emphasis on several points which I thought were of importance to Bolivia. I sought particularly to enlist his support in the effort to encourage the more advanced Latin American countries to share their current high level of foreign exchange earnings with the less developed Latin countries through such institutions as the IDB and the Andean Development Corporation. I sought to underline the importance the Secretary attaches to this meeting while at the same time seeking to dispel any expectation that a miracle will be achieved in Mexico. I then sought to elicit from the Foreign Minister comments on Bolivia's own position for the meeting, reactions to the points I had made, and any observations about what Bolivia might expect from the U.S. during the meeting.

2. Foreign Minister first of all asked me to convey to Washington authorities the great appreciation of the Bolivian government for the prompt and effective help provided through an airlift of 2 C-130 aircraft from the Canal Zone, bringing relief supplies for flood victims in Bolivia. He then went on to say that he felt that US/Bolivian relations were excellent and that Bolivia had nothing special that it wished to accomplish at the Mexico City meeting other than to participate constructively with us. He expressed pleasure that there was an indication of the joining of the Latin Americans and the US with the rest of the world and not just a hemispheric unity in isolation. He said Bolivia is concerned about its continued need for aid and certain old issues such as access to the sea, but that he did not feel these were appropriate for the high level meeting. As to the format, the Minister felt that it was most appropriate for us to work through the expert staff now working in Mexico City. Nonetheless, he expressed his view that all participants would accept Secretary Kissinger's wishes as to the format because if the Secretary feels this is the most efficient way to proceed, the Latins should accept his opinion, given his demonstrable skill and successes in other international discussions. Foreign Minister agreed that there should not be a whole series of Latin American speakers nor should there be bilateral discussions with all Latin American countries. He said it was his opinion that three or four countries might speak for the entire hemisphere in the closed sessions.

3. I received the strong impression that the Foreign Minister is relying heavily on his staff for guidance as to his conduct and the substance of his position in Mexico. This is probably in keeping with his experience as an army general and may also reflect that he is not very capable of dealing with foreign policy matters. It is important, therefore, that US representatives in Mexico establish contact with Bolivian Foreign Ministry staff if Bolivian understanding and cooperation is required during the conference. At this time in Mexico City Ambassador Fuentes Ibanez and Javier Murillo of the Foreign Ministry are doing basic work with the Mexican authorities. The Foreign Minister expects to arrive in Mexico City the morning of Feb. 15 accompanied by his principal Foreign Ministry assistant, Marcelo Ostria. I will meet with Ostria before his departure and report any impressions we receive from that conversation.

4. In conclusion we can expect no problems from the Bolivians and a high measure of support if we wish it.
