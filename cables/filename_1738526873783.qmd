# DEPARTMENT OF STATE TELEGRAM
**UNCLASSIFIED**

::: {.cable-meta}
:::


1. IN A SPEECH TO THE NATION ON THE EVENING OF JULY 23, PRESIDENT
BANZER ANNOUNCED THAT PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS WILL BE HELD IN THE
SECOND HALF OF OCTOBER 1975, WITH THE FORMAL INAUGURATION OF A
NEW PRESIDENT TO OCCUR IN DECEMBER OF THAT YEAR. BANZER ALSO
REVEALED THAT THE NEW NATIONAL COUNCIL ON STRUCTURAL REFORMS,
CREATED ON JULY 23, WILL PRESENT A SERIES OF MAJOR PROPOSALS TO
THE NATION BY JANUARY 23, 1975. THESE PROPOSALS, INCLUDING A
"PROGRAM OF NATIONAL OBJECTIVES", A REVISED CONSTITUTION, A SERIES
OF ADMINISTRATIVE, ECONOMIC AND JURIDICAL REFORMS, A POLITICAL
PARTIES LAW AND AN ELECTORAL STATUTE, WILL BE SUBMITTED TO A
NATIONAL REFERENDUM ON MARCH 23, WHATEVER THE RESULT OF THE
REFERENDUM, ELECTIONS WILL STILL BE HELD IN LATE OCTOBER 1975,
EITHER UNDER THE OLD CONSTITUTION OR UNDER THE NEW CONSTITUTION
AND LAWS TO BE PROPOSED BY THE COUNCIL.


2. COMMENT: THE NEWLY-CREATED COUNCIL ON STRUCTURAL REFORMS HAS
BEEN THE SUBJECT OF WIDESPREAD SPECULATION SINCE IT WAS FIRST ANNOUNC
ED
IN EARLY JULY. DESPITE THE BREADTH OF THE COUNCIL'S MANDATE AND THE
SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME IN WHICH IT MUST PREPARE THE NEW CONSTITUTION
AND OTHER IMPORTANT NEW LEGAL PROCEDURES, ONLY THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF






 251126Z


APPEARS TO HAVE ANY CLEAR IDEA OF THE NATURE OF THE REFORMS TO BE




                      

                 

PROPOSED BY THE COUNCIL, AND HE IS NOT REVEALING HIS THINKING AT
THIS TIME. CLEARLY, HOWEVER, THE COUNCIL'S RECOMMENDATIONS WILL
REFLECT A CONSENSUS OF VIEWS HELD BY LOYAL PRO-GOVERNMENT ELEMENTS:
THE THIRTY-MEMBER COUNCIL WILL REPORTEDLY CONTAIN FOUR REPRESENTATIVE
S
EACH OF THE MNR, FSB, FUERZAS REVOLUCIONARIAS BARRIENTISTAS,
CAMPESINOS AND ARMED FORCES, THEREBY ASSURING THE GOB OF A TWO-THIRDS
MAJORITY IN THE COUNCIL'S INTERNAL DELIBERATIONS.


3. BANZER'S ANNOUNCEMENTS ALSO COME AT A PSYCHOLOGICALLY-IMPORTANT
MOMENT, SINCE MANY OF THE GOVERNMENT'S CRITICS HAVE RECENTLY BEGUN
TO CHARGE THAT THE LACK OF AN ELECTION TIMETABLE WAS EVIDENCE OF A
GOB PLAN TO FURTHER POSTPONE ELECTIONS BEYOND 1975. OPPOSITION
SPOKESMEN PRESUMABLY WILL NOW CONCENTRATE THEIR FIRE ON THE BANZER
GOVERNMENT'S REFUSAL TO PROCLAIM A GENERAL POLITICAL AMNESTY OR TO
ALLOW SUCH EXILED OPPOSITIONISTS AS WALTER GUEVARA ARCE AND PDC
CHIEF BENJAMIN MIGUEL TO RETURN TO BOLIVIA.
STEDMAN
