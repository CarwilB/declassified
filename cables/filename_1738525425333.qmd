# DEPARTMENT OF STATE TELEGRAM
**UNCLASSIFIED**

1. SUMMARY: LA PAZ MORNING PAPERS REPORTED CROWDS AT THE "ANTI-
IMPERIALIST" DEMONSTRATIONS AROUND BOLIVIA OCTOBER 25, AS WELL
AS THE MARCH IN LA PAZ, WERE SIGNIFICANT. MOST SPEECHES DURING
THE RALLIES ATTACKED THE UNITED STATES AND DENOUNCED THE PROS-
PECTIVE SALE OF TIN FROM ITS STRATEGIC RESERVES. CHILE, ITS
GOVERNMENT, AND ITS OAS REPRESENTATIVE ALSO WERE ATTACKED FOR
DENYING BOLIVIA ACCESS TO THE SEA. SEVERAL POLITICIANS
JOINED MARCHERS IN LA PAZ, BUT NOTABLEY ABSENT WAS LABOR
LEADER JUAN LECHIN. END SUMMARY.


2. TO MOST OBSERVERS THE OCTOBE R 25 "ANTI-IMPERIALIST" MARCH
IN LA PAZ APPEARED TO BE THE BEST ORGANIZED AND BEST ATTENDED






 290743Z


DEMONSTRATION SPONSORED BY THE CONFEDERATION OF BOLIVIAN WORKERS
(COB) IN RECENT YEARS. ESTIMATES OF CROWD SIZE VARY. TWO OF
LA PAZ' NEWSPAPERS, HOY AND PRESENCIA, ESTIMATED THE CROWD TO
"NUMBER IN THE THOUSANDS." EL DIARIO, ANOTHER LA PAZ MORNING
PAPER, REPORTED 15,000 PEOPLE PARTICIPATED IN THE DEMONSTRATIN.
BY WAY OF CONTRAST, POLICE COLONEL SALINAS, WHO COMMANDED THE
RIOT POLICE DETACHMENT OUTSIDE THE SHERATON DURING THE 80 MINUTE

PARADE, CALCULATED THE MARCHERS NUMBERED SIX OR SEVEN THOUSAND
PEOPLE.


3. MOST SPEECHES BEFORE AND AFTER THE MARCH DENOUNCED THE US AND
THE PROSPECTIVE SALE OF TIN
FROM STRATEGIC STOCKPILES. FELIX LACUMSA, STUDENT LEADER AT
SAN ANDRES UNIVERSITY, ACCUSED THE US OF "DEALING A HARD BLOW
TO BOLIVIA'S ONGOING DEMOCRATIZATION PROCESS" WHILE GENARO FLORES,
A CAMPESINO LEADER, CHARGED THE US WITH BEING "THE FIRST TO
VIOLATE HUMAN RIGHTS."


4. CHOICE WORDS WERE ALSO RESERVED FOR THE CHILEAN GOVERNMENT
AND ITS OAS REPRESENTATIVE FOR DENYING BOLIVIA ACCESS TO THE SEA.
OSCAR SALAS, A LEADER OF THE MINERS, ANNOUNCED "THE
PEOPLE WILL CONTINUE FIGHTING UNTIL BOLIVIA RETURNS TO THE SEA."
CHANTS DURING THE MARCH ALSO CALLED FOR "DEATH TO DAZA
(CHILEAN OAS REP) AND PINOCHET" AND "DOWN WITH CHILEANS."
SOME PLACARDS CARRIED BY FACTORY WORKERS CALLED FOR THE DISMISSAL
OF CHILEANS WORKING IN BOLIVIAN FACTORIES.


5. ABSENT FROM THE LA PAZ MARCH WAS JUAN LECHIN, EXECUTIVE
SECRETARY OF THE COB. BUT, AMONG MARCHERS
LABATT IDENTIFIED MARCELO QUIROGA SANTA CRUZ, PS-1 LEADER AND
ITS DEPUTY FOR COCHABAMBA; OSCAR EID, MIR LEADER; AND JAIME PAZ
ZAMORA, MIR LEADER AND UDP VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE IN 1979.
THEY WERE WELL RECEIVED BY THE CROWD OUTSIDE THE SHERATON HOTEL.






 290743Z



6. LA PAZ NEWSPAPERS OF OCTOBER 26 ALSO COMMENTED BRIEFLY
ON SIMILAR DEMONSTRATIONS IN ORURO AND COCHABAMBA. SPEECHES
APPERAED TO BE SIMILAR IN CONTENT. PRESENCIA ESTIMATED THE
COCHABAMBA MARCH DREW TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE. HOY CLAIMED
"THOUSANDS" OF PEOPLE PARTICIPATED IN THE ORURO RALLY.


7. COMMENT: THE LARGE TURN OUT AT THE COB DEMONSTRATIONS
THROUGHOUT BOLIVIA CAN BE EXPLAINED BY THE FACT THAT: (1)
TIN AND ACCESS TO THE SEA ARE THE TWO ISSUES IN BOLIVIA ON
WHICH THERE IS WIDESPREAD CONSENSUS; (2) STUDENTS JOINED
THE COB MARCH; AND (3) THE DEMONSTRATIONS WERE SCHEDULED
FOR MID-AFTERNOON INSTEAD OF AFTER WORKING HOURS. DESPITE THE
DEPTH OF BOLIVIAN FEELINGS ON THESE ISSUES, THE
DEMONSTRATIONS WERE IMPRESSIVE FOR THEIR DISCIPLINE AND PEACE-
FULNESS.
