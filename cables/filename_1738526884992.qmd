# DEPARTMENT OF STATE TELEGRAM
**UNCLASSIFIED**

::: {.cable-meta}
:::


1. ALTHOUGH I RECOGNIZE THAT BOLIVIA IS NOT A "KEY" COUNTRY IN
LATIN AMERICA, I BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL SOUND REASONS
FOR INCLUDING IT AMONG THOSE COUNTRIES ON THE CONSULTATION
LIST. THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THESE REASONS IS THAT BOLIVIA
INEVITABLY WILL BE A FACTOR IN ANY CONFLICT BETWEEN CHILE
AND PERU. WITH PROPER ENCOURAGEMENT AND SUPPORT, BOLIVIA
COULD PLAY A CONSTRUCTIVE ROLE AND PERHAPS AN IMPORTANT ONE
IN PREVENTING CHILEAN-PERUVIAN TENSIONS FROM GETTING OUT OF
HAND. OUR CONSULTATIONS MIGHT HELP PRECLUDE BOLIVIA FROM
MAKING AN IRRATIONAL MOVE TO SUPPORT ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER
AND COMPLICATE THE ISSUES EVEN FURTHER.


2. ANOTHER IMPORTANT REASON IS THAT THE PRESENT BOLIVIAN
GOVERNMENT, WHICH TOPPLED AN EXTREMIST AND HOSTILE REGIME, IS
VERY FRIENDLY TO US; DISPOSED TO COOPERATE WITH US ON
INTERNATIONAL ISSUES; AND IS MOVING TOWARD OPENING ITS
DOMESTIC POLITICAL PROCESSES. THESE CONSULTATIONS WOULD HELP
ASSURE CONTINUED BOLIVIAN SUPPORT FOR OUR POSITIONS, BUT
MORE IMPORTANTLY, WOULD PROVIDE A USEFUL SHORING UP OF
PRESTIGE FOR THE BANZER REGIME. I BELIEVE BANZER HAS A
GOOD CHANCE TO STAY ON UNTIL ELECTIONS SOMETIME IN 1975,






 032232Z


BUT HIS ABILITY TO GOVERN EFFECTIVELY DURING THIS TIME AND




                      

                   

TO KEEP THE PROCESS OF CONSTITUTIONALIZATION ON THE TRACK
WOULD BE ADVANCED IN THE MEASURE THAT HIS PRESTIGE IS
AUGMENTED. THIS WOULD BE IN OUR INTEREST.


3. A THIRD REASON APPLIES TO ALL THE SMALLER COUNTRIES IN THE
HEMISPHERE, I.E., OUR NEW DIALOGUE SHOULD BE CARRIED ON WITH
ALL THE COUNTRIES, NOT JUST THE BIG ONES, OR WE MAY IN THE
PROCESS OF CONSULTING WITH THE "KEY" COUNTRIES OFFEND THE
SMALL ONES, PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN OUTSPOKENLY
FRIENDLY. THIS WOULD BE PARTICULARLY TRUE IN BOLIVIA'S CASE
WERE OUR TEAM TO VISIT PERU AND CHILE AND NOT BOLIVIA.


4. THERE ARE SOME GOB-GROUPS IN EXISTENCE NOW THAT HAVE
POLICY PLANNING FUNCTIONS AFFECTING FOREIGN POLICY, SUCH
AS THE COMISION MARITIMA, THE CONSEJO POLITICO NACIONALISTA,
THE ALTO MANDO MILITAR, AND THE AS YET UNSTAFFED ADVISORY
COUNCIL TO THE FOREIGN MINISTRY. NEVERTHELESS, EACH OF THESE
HAS CERTAIN DRAWBACKS, AND IT PROBABLY WOULD BE BETTER IF
THE GOB FORMED A SPECIAL GROUP OF DECISION MAKERS AND
PLANNERS TO MEET WITH OUR TEAM. THIS WOULD NOT PRESENT
A PROBLEM. ON THE CONTRARY, IT WOULD PROVIDE USEFUL PUBLICITY
HERE AND ENSURE THE KIND OF PARTICIPATION THAT WE WANT.
I WOULD IMAGINE THAT SUCH A GROUP WOULD BE CHAIRED BY THE
UNDER-SECRETARY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS, MARCELO OSTRIA, AND
COMPOSED OF SENIOR MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES, FORMER
FOREIGN MINISTERS SUCH AS ALBERTO CRESPO AND OTHER EXPERTS
DRAWN FROM THE GROUPS MENTIONED ABOVE.


5. CERTAINLY THE GOB WOULD WISH TO TALK ABOUT ITS PROBLEM OF
LACK OF ADEQUATE ACCESS TO THE SEA AND THE CURRENT TENSIONS
BETWEEN CHILE AND PERU WHICH MIGHT BEAR ON THIS PROBLEM.
ANOTHER THEME OF INTEREST TO BOTH SIDES IS OUR STOCKPILE
POLICY ON STRATEGIC ITEMS AND HOW BOLIVIA CAN COOPERATE IN
THAT POLICY. BOLIVIA OF COURSE WOULD WISH TO DISCUSS CUBA
POLICY, AND WOULD BE RECEPTIVE TO DISCUSSING WAYS TO UNDERCUT
STEAMROLLER TACTICS BY THE LDC'S IN INTERNATIONAL FORA.
AS THE DEPARTMENT KNOWS, BOLIVIA CONTINUES VIGOROUSLY TO
OPPOSE THE RE-ENTRY OF CUBA INTO THE OAS AND TAKES
VERY SERIOUSLY OUR PLEDGE TO CONSULT WITH OAS MEMBERS BEFORE
WE CHANGE OUR CURRENT CUBA POLICY. WE COULD USE THE






 032232Z


OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE FOREIGN PLICY OF BRAZIL,
ARGENTINA AND VENEZUELA AS SEEN THROUGH BOLIVIAN EYES.


6. I BELIEVE IT WOULD BE PRUDENT, AT LEAST IN THE EARLY
STAGES OF THESE CONSULTATIONS, TO STAGGER THE VISITS TO
PERU, CHILE AND BOLIVIA SO THAT IT DOES NOT APPEAR
THAT WE HAVE DECIDED TO TAKE AN ACTIVE PART IN SETTLING
THE PROBLEMS INVOLVING THESE COUNTRIES. FOR THE DOMESTIC




                   

                    

POLITICAL REASONS MENTIONED ABOVE, IT WOULD BE PREFERABLE
TO SCHEDULE THE VISIT TO BOLIVIA EARLIER RATHER THAN LATER.


7. PLEASE ADVISE.
STEDMAN
