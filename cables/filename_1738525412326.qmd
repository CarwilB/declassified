# DEPARTMENT OF STATE TELEGRAM
**UNCLASSIFIED**

1. Embassy has previous projected Bolivia's 1979 tin exports at approximately 30,000 metric tons with the caveat that serious political problems or possible civil strife connected with the upcoming elections could invalidate our estimate. (Bolivia's 1978 exports of tin were 29,696 MT's worth approximately US$335.76 million.)

2. However, based on an apparent moderate slowdown in tin production which is now being noted, we now project that this year's exports will be closer to 28,500 MT's. Again, the caveat cited in Para one applies to this estimate also. (If exports simply maintained the pace of the first trimester, exports would reach only about 26,000 MT's. We believe, however, that this rate will pick-up somewhat.)

3. In spite of the projected fall in tin production, expected higher prices for Bolivia's other metallic minerals exports (principally silver, tungsten, lead and zinc) are expected to provide Bolivia with total 1979 export earnings of approximately $527 million (CIF value), 3.1 percent higher than the total achieved last year.

4. Embassy's projections have been shared informally with IMF officials in La Paz. Although the IMF's own estimates of physical volumes closely parallel ours, the fund's higher price for tin gives a more optimistic bottom line.

5. Post's latest projections in detail:
