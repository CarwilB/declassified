# DEPARTMENT OF STATE TELEGRAM
**UNCLASSIFIED**

1. **Summary:** You are authorized to provide the following response to General Banzer in answer to his letter of September 19, to President Carter.

2. **Begin Text:** Dear General Banzer: I have been asked to respond to your thoughtful letter of September 19 addressed to President Carter.

My government sees the decision on the part of Bolivia to place itself in consonance with the Andean region's movement toward democracy as a highly important accomplishment. It is our belief that this step will enhance Bolivia's international standing and ability to realize its most important diplomatic and economic objectives. There should be no question of our support for the democratization process which is continuing, and our admiration for the accomplishments realized thus far. My government also shares a deep concern for the possible consequences which might arise through indiscriminate, uncontrolled sale of tin. It is for this reason that the United States is committed to consult, prior to any sales, with the International Tin Council as well as with the tin producers. President Carter has assured the Government of Bolivia that we will manage any eventual disposals from the strategic buffer stocks so as to safeguard against disruption of the tin market and the economic position of producers.

The United States believes that consumers and producers share an interest in a healthy world tin market. It has thus been a matter of increasing concern to us that in recent years world tin production has lagged behind demand despite rapidly increasing prices. World consumption of tin metal is expected to exceed production again in 1979, and world stocks are well below historical levels. In view of these considerations, we believe it is in the long run interest of all signatories to the International Tin Agreement to compensate for this shortage and thus discourage further substitution of alternative materials for tin.

The legislation now pending in the United States Congress would provide authority for the disposal of 35,000 tons of tin, of which up to 5,000 tons is authorized for a contribution to the International Tin Council buffer stock. The sales would be carried out over a period of three or more years. It is the position of the United States that a disposal program which is conducted with careful regard for developments in the world economy, and in consultation with the International Tin Council and tin producers, will not jeopardize the foreign exchange earnings which are so vital to the continued economic growth of Bolivia.

In closing, I wish to reiterate that the United States is deeply aware of the need to ensure the democratization process in Bolivia. I am sure you share this view and will be reassured that the legislation now being considered by the United States Senate would not disrupt the world tin market. Sincerely, Paul H. Boeker. End Text.
