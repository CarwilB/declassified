# DEPARTMENT OF STATE TELEGRAM
**UNCLASSIFIED**

2. **Summary:** The relatively quiet labor scene that prevailed in Bolivia during 1978 has continued into the first part of 1979. The trade unions, eager to avoid strikes that could jeopardize the democratization process, have been moderate in their wage demands, which the business sector and the GOB have been willing to accommodate. The result has been 14 months of relative labor peace. While most observers expect quiescence to continue through the July elections, there are three factors that could destabilize the situation: (A) increasing pressure from the rank and file for additional wage increases because of the rising rate of inflation; (B) a public posture by the GOB not to grant any wage increases to public sector employees and leave this question to the incoming elected government; and (C) the upcoming (May 1) congress of the Bolivian Workers Center (COB) and the possibility that longtime COB leader Juan Lechin Oquendo might try to provoke labor agitation in order to enhance his reelection bid. Nevertheless, with labor's wanting to avoid any disruption of the democratization process, the chances of avoiding serious strikes appear to be reasonably good. End summary.

3. During the first ten weeks of 1979, the relatively tranquil state of labor-management relations that prevailed in Bolivia during 1978 has continued. As discussed in the 1978 Annual Labor Report (REFAIR), the Bolivian labor movement, having been badly burned by the suspension of labor freedoms from 1974 to 1978 under the Banzer regime, has been a strong supporter of the democratization process and the return of elected civilian government. Accordingly, in order to avoid possibly disruptive strikes that could jeopardize this process, the unions have been deliberately modest in their wage demands.

4. In turn, the private sector has been forthcoming in its willingness to accommodate these demands. Bolivian entrepreneurs have recognized that the workers have been caught in an inflationary squeeze (with inflation running at 18 percent in 1978 and around 30 percent (annual rate) thus far this year, according to informed sources), and they have responded with wage increases that have compensated the workers in full or in large part for losses in purchasing power.

5. In the public sector, both the Pereda and Padilla administrations have pursued a similarly moderate wage policy. The result has been that in the 14 months since labor freedoms were restored in January 1978, there has not been a single major strike in Bolivia, and what strikes and work stoppages that have occurred have been few and of short duration.

6. Although most leaders and observers in both the labor and business sectors believe that this relative stability will continue through July 1, there are a few problems ahead.

7. The great majority of labor leaders remain as committed as before to the democratization process, but they are feeling increasing pressure from the rank and file to obtain additional wage increases this year to compensate for the sharply increased rate of inflation.

8. Nevertheless, this pressure may not necessarily present insurmountable problems in the private sector because business leaders in most cases appear to be prepared to negotiate wage increases sufficient to meet at least the minimum demands of the rank and file.

9. Negotiations are presently continuing with the factory workers and construction workers confederations. The issue in the former case is not salary (at least not yet), but whether the wage increase to be granted should be negotiated between the Chamber of Industry and the Labor Confederation (labor's position) or between each individual factory and its union (business's position). Although both sides appear to want to avoid a strike, negotiations have been prolonged and patience may be drawing short. A prolonged strike, though, would appear unlikely.

10. The situation in the public sector may be somewhat more difficult because in February President Padilla announced that the GOB would be unable to grant any wage increases to government employees due to the economic problems facing the country. Requests for wage increases would have to be decided by the civilian government taking office on August 6. Amazingly, a secret salary increase granted by Padilla to military officers has not become generally known.

11. Nevertheless, there may be some flexibility in the GOB's position. Bolivia's two teacher confederations have been trying to negotiate a wage increase for months, but the Minister of Education, Colonel Jose Olvis (who may be on his way out), has refused to discuss the issue and has simply reiterated the GOB's public position on public sector wage increases. However, President Padilla, according to the leader of the La Paz Urban Teachers Federation, met with the teachers before departing on his trip to Venezuela and Brazil and told them that he would resolve the problem in their favor on his return to Bolivia. The teachers appear eager to avoid a strike and thus some solution appears probable.
