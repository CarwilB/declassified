# DEPARTMENT OF STATE TELEGRAM
**UNCLASSIFIED**

1. MINISTER OF INTERIOR PEREDA ANNOUNCED JULY 24 THAT EXILED
MAJOR GARY PRADO WAS ARRESTED IN LA PAZ ON THE PREVIOUS EVENING,
WHILE ENGAGED IN A SUBVERSIVE MEETING. PEREDA CLAIMED THAT THE
GOB HAS PROOF THAT PRADO HAD JOINED FORCES WITH LEFTIST EXILES
TO OVERTHROW THE BANZER GOVERNMENT. FIFTEEN OTHER PERSONS HAVE
BEEN ARRESTED WITH PRADO, INCLUDING SECOND LIEUTENANT CARLOS
PRADO YEPEZ AND TWO PROFESSORS AT SAN ANDRES UNIVERSITY IN LA
PAZ. ACCORDING TO PEREDA, GARY PRADO WILL BE SENT INTO EXILE
ONCE AGAIN WITHIN A FEW DAYS.


2. AT THE SAME PRESS CONFERENCE, MININTERIOR PEREDA ALSO REVEALED
THE CONTENTS OF AN ALLEGED LETTER FROM EXILED PDC CHIEF BENJAMIN
MIGUEL TO HIS FOLLOWERS INSIDE BOLIVIA, IN WHICH MIGUEL DESCRIBES
THE PETTY RIVALRIES AND PERSONALITY CLASHES WHICH DIVIDE THE
LEFTIST GROUPS IN EXILE IN BUENOS AIRES. ACCORDING TO THIS
LETTER, RECENT MEETINGS OF MIGUEL AND PRA CHIEF WALTER
GUEVARA ARCE WITH SUCH EXILED BOLIVIA POLITICIANS AS HERNAN
SILES ZUAZO, JUAN LECHIN, EX-PRESIDENTS JUAN JOSE TORRES AND
ALFREDO OVANDO, ETC., REVEALED THE ANARCHIC STATE OF THE LEFTIST
OPPOSITION RESIDENT IN BUENOS AIRES: IN PARTICULAR, THE MIGUEL
LETTER COMMENTS SHARPLY ON THE COMPETING ASPIRATIONS OF SILES,






 252151Z


TORRES AND OVADO, EACH OF WHOM HARBORS PERSONAL AMBITIONS TO




                      

                  

PRESIDE OVER A FUTURE LEFTIST GOVERNMENT IN LA PAZ. THE LETTER
ALSO INDICATES THAT MIGUEL, GUEVARA AND OTHER EXILES HAVE ESTAB-
LISHED CONTACT WITH ARMY OFFICERS EXILED FOLLOWING JUNE 5 1970
ATTEMPT.


3. RESPONDING TO NEWSMENS' QUESTIONS, PEREDA STATED THAT THE
CURRENT STATE OF SIEGE WILL NOT BE EXTENDED BEYOND ITS PRESENT
JULY 28 TERMINATION DATE.


4. COMMENT: WHETHER AUTHENTIC OR FICTITIOUS, THE MIGUEL LETTER
COMES AT A CONVENIENT MOMENT FOR THE GOB FOR SEVERAL REASONS. BY
PORTRAYING THE LEFTIST EXILES AS A GROUP OF PETTY CAUDILLOS
COMPETING SELFISHLY FOR ABSOLUTE POWER OVER THE OPPOSITION TO THE
BANZER GOVERNMENT, THE LETTER DISCREDITS THESE FORCES AT A TIME
WHEN THE GOB IS SEEKING TO FORTIFY ITSELF FOR THE 1975 ELECTORAL
CONTESTS. AT THE SAME TIME, PUBLICATION OF THE LETTER WILL HELP TO
ENSURE FURTHER DISSENSION AND CONFUSION IN THE ALREADY DIVIDED RANKS
OF THE EXILE MOVEMENT. FINALLY, THE ALLUSIONS IN THE LETTER TO
CONTACTS WITH THE JUNIOR OFFICER MOVEMENT REINFORCE THE CASE
WHICH THE MINISTRY OF INTERIOR SEEKS TO MAKE AGAINST GARY
PRADO, WHILE DISCREDITING THE POLITICAL MOTIVES OF OTHER
MEMBERS OF THE "GENERATIONAL" OFFICERS' MOVEMENT AS WELL.
STEDMAN
