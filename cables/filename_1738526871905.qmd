# DEPARTMENT OF STATE TELEGRAM
**UNCLASSIFIED**

1. COUNTRY TEAM BELIEVES US INTERESTS WELL SERVED
BY CONTINUATION PRESENT LEVEL OF PUBLIC SAFETY TRAINING
OF BOLIVIANS AT FACILITIES IN CONTINENTAL US, PARTICU-
LARLY WHERE SUCH TRAINING INCLUDES NARCOTICS COURSES.
AS DEPT AWARE, EMBASSY IS RECEIVING CLOSE COOPERATION
FROM BOLIVIAN POLICE IN COMBATTING ILLICIT NARCOTICS
TRAFFIC.


2. RELAXATION OF POLITICAL TENSIONS IN WAKE OF FORMATION
OF ALL-MILITARY CABINET AND ANNOUNCEMENT OF ELECTIONS IN
1975 SHOULD BE REFLECTED IN GREATER TOLERANCE OF POLITICAL
ACTIVITY, INCLUDING THAT OF OPPOSITION GROUPS. AS PRE-
VIOUSLY REPORTED, MIN OF INTERIOR HAS BEEN INVOLVED FOR
SOME TIME IN REVIEWING THE CASES OF POLITICAL PRISONERS.
THIS REVIEW PROCESS HAS ALREADY RESULTED IN THE RELEASE OF
SEVERAL PRISONERS, AND IT APPEARS MORE WILL BE RELEASED IN
THE COMING WEEK.


3. POLITICAL PARTIES, INCLUDING SOME OPPOSITION GROUPS,
HAVE APPLAUDED GOVERNMENT'S DECISION TO CALL FOR ELECTIONS
IN 1975, THOSE IN OPPOSITION ANTICIPATING THAT A FAIRLY
BROAD AMNESTY WILL BE DECLARED IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS WHICH
WILL ENABLE SOME EXILED LEADERS SUCH AS GUEVARA ARCE (PRA)
AND BENJAMIN MIGUEL (PDC) TO RETURN AND RESUME THEIR PARTI-






 111447Z


CIPATION IN BOLIVIAN POLITICS.




                      

                 


4. IN SHORT, THE GOB'S PERCEIVED NEED FOR SOME POLITICAL
REPRESSION WHEN ANTI-GOVERNMENT PLOTTING IS UNCOVERED HAS
NOW BEEN GREATLY REDUCED, AND WE FORESEE A POLITICAL OPENING
OF SORTS WHICH SHOULD HELP TO IMPROVE BOLIVIA'S IMAGE IN
THE US.
