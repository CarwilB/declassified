# DEPARTMENT OF STATE TELEGRAM
**UNCLASSIFIED**

::: {.cable-meta}
:::


1. Bolivia is now trying to emerge from a two-year period of political turbulence, short-lived and ineffective governments, economic decline and intense military-civilian tension. The most consistent trends during this period have been broad popular pressure for civilian government and growing anti-military sentiment, culminating in the strident repudiation and undoing of the Natusch coup and installation of the Gueiler government in November 1979.

2. US-Bolivian relations are excellent and US prestige in the country has reached a new high, primarily because the US in both good times and bad (the Natusch coup) has been consistently on the right side of the popular ground swell for human rights and civilian, representative government. Our support in the OAS for Bolivia's aspiration for access to the Pacific has also added significantly to US prestige here. Our relationship with the military has weakened concomitantly because of our association with the tarnished respectability and political decline of military government and because of the supplanting of US training and orientation by the much harder line of Argentine military institutions in particular.

3. The sharp cuts in the FY 80 aid program have threatened the image of the US as a provider of significant economic support for Bolivia, at a time when the government is courageously and successfully laying the financial policy base for renewed development momentum. At the same time the highly successful PL-480 Title III program has proved an ideal developmental and political instrument for the Bolivian environment (and has been widely publicized by USICA and Bolivian media). On the other hand, prolonged US consideration of GSA tin disposals has been and will remain the most volatile and negative factor in the US-Bolivian relationship as Bolivia enters an election campaign and continues efforts to consolidate civilian government.

4. The near-term prospects for that consolidation remain precarious as a weak, if determined, Gueiler government enforces an unpopular economic stabilization program and tries to guide an uncertain and possibly turbulent electoral process. The longer-term prognosis is brighter, both economically and politically.

B. Bilateral Issues

1. The three areas of weakness in the US-Bolivian relationship remain our so-far inadequate response to Bolivia's current economic plight, weak US influence on the military, and backlash to current US policy on tin disposals.

2. As Bolivia tries to emerge from virtual financial insolvency the PL-480 Title III program has been a most effective and widely applauded instrument of US support. We should now take advantage of the program's strong development record to increase the FY 80 allocation and thereby the short-term financial impact. This will both allow the government to maintain a higher level of investment in rural areas and help relieve the severe foreign exchange bind. As political stability increases the government's ability to administer additional project funds, this important program to achieve longer term economic strength and structural reform should increase accordingly.

3. As our IMET levels have declined over the last decade, so has the influence of the US and US ideals in a Bolivian military which desperately needs reorientation toward an apolitical and military professional role. Some blame the US counter insurgency doctrine of the 60s for the Bolivian military's fixation with imaginary internal security problems, but this is pure scapegoat seeking. In fact, the military's interventionism pre-dates our training programs and our more recent inability to finance training in the US has coincided with the evolution of arrogant and power-hungry attitudes in a faction of the officer corps. Increased IMET to finance military training in the US would not in itself solve the problem of military reorientation, but it would contribute importantly to parallel Bolivian efforts.

4. The most persistently negative issue in bilateral relations remains US tin disposals. Over the past two years continuing Congressional consideration of a disposal authorization, even in the absence of actual sales, has produced constant abrasion in an otherwise smooth bilateral relationship. When disposals are authorized, we need to sell modest regular monthly
