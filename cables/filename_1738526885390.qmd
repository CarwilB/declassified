# DEPARTMENT OF STATE TELEGRAM
**UNCLASSIFIED**

1. RELIABLE SOURCE IN TE FSB HAS PROVIDED THE FOLLOWING
INFORMATION, WHICH PUTS INTO PERSPECTIVE CERTAIN RECENT DECLARA-
TIONS OF FALANGE NATIONAL CHIEF MARIO GUTIERREZ. GUTIERREZ MADE
HIS STATEMENTS IN DEFENSE OF DR PAZ ESTENSSORO AND CIRO HUMBOLDT
AS THE LEGITIMATE CHIEF AND SUB-CHIEF OF THE MNR BECAUSE HE WAS
CONCERNED OVER THE RECENT GOVERNMENT-IMPOSED CHANGES IN THAT PARTY'S
LEADERSHIP, FROM PAZ TO HUMBOLDT, AND HUMBOLDT TO GUILLERMO FORTUN.
GUTIERREZ BELIEVES THAT THE GOB WILL NOW MOVE TO REPLACE AN IN-
CREASINGLY WEAK FORTUN WITH RAUL LEMA PELAEZ, AND THAT AT AN APPRO-
PRIATE MOMENT IT MIGHT ALSO SEEK TO BRING ABOUT HIS OWN REPLACEMENT
AS FSB CHIEF BY A MORE COMPLIANT FALANNGE LEADER. THUS, GUEIRREZ"
DEFENSE OF PAZ WAS IN REALITY A DEFENSE OF HIS OWN LONG-TERM INTERESTS.


AS THE CHIEF OF A NATIONAL POLITICAL PARTY.


2. AT THE SAME TIME, GUTIERREZ IS CONCERNED ABOUT THE GROWING
EVIDENCE THAT PRESIDENT BANZER IS FOMENTING THE GROWTH OF THE
BARRIENTISTA FRB AS A COUNTER-WEIGHT TO THE MNR AND THE FSB.
FEARING THA THE BANZER GOVERNMENT'S LONG-TERM STRATEGY MIGHT






 042125Z


INCLUDE SUPPORTING THE REGIME'S MILITARY CANDIDATE FOR THE




                        

                  

PRESIDENCY IN 1975 WITH CAMPESINO VOTES AND A SUBSERVIENT CIVILIAN
FRONT (POSSIBLY AN ALLIANCE OF BARRIENTISTA PARTIES), GUTIERREZ
HAD THE FALANGE PROPOSE HIS OWN NAME AS A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE,
AND THEN CAME OUT WITH A STATEMENT FAVORING THE CONCEPT OF A JOINT
FSB-MNR ELECTORAL SLATE. IN THIS WAY, GUTIERREZ HOPED TO GIVE
WARNING TO BANZER THAT THE ULTIMATE RESULT OF THE POSSIBLE GOB
STRATEGY OUTLINED ABOVE MIGHT, AS A LAST RESORT, BE THE OPEN
OPPOSITION OF THE COUNTRY'S TWO MAJOR POLITICAL PARTIES TO THE
GOVERNMENT'S OFFICIAL CANDIDATE.


3. GUTIERREZ ALSO STATED THAT HE FAVORS A GENERAL POLITICAL AMNESTY,
BEGINNING WITH INTERNAL AMNESTIES IN EACH POLITICAL PARTY, INCLUDING
ONE IN THE FSB WHICH MIGHT INCLUDE DISSIDENT FALANGE LEADER CARLOS
VALVERDE. ACCORDING TO OUR SOURCE, THIS STATEMENT WAS DESIGNED TO
PLACATE GUTIERREZ' BASE IN THE SANTA CRUZ AREA, WHERE VALVERDE IS
ALSO VERY POPULAR. GIVEN THE PERSONAL UNPOPULARITY OF DR. PAZ
ESTENSSORO IN SANTA CRUZ, GUTIERREZ COULD HARDLY SPEAK FAVORABLY
OF PAZ WITHOUT ALSO SEEKING, BY WAY OF COMPENSATION, TO MAKE A
GESTURE TOWARD ONE OF SANTA CRUZ' EXILED FAVORITE SONS. GUTIERREZ'
ULTIMATE INTENTIONS TOWARD VALVERDE WOULD INCLUDE HIS RE-INTEGRATION
INTO FALANAGE, AND SUBSEQUENT ASSIGNMENT TO A REMOTE DIPLOMATIC
POST COMFORTABLY FAR FROM BOLIVIA.


4. COMMENT: EMBASSY BELIEVES CHANCES OF
MNR SUPPORTING AN FSB CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT ARE VIRTUALLY NIL.
IT IS MUCH MORE LIKELY THAT PAZ WILL APPROACH THE ELECTIONS ON
TWO FRONTS, INCLUDING A CENTER LEFT COALITION WITH ITS OWN
CANDIDATE, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME NEGOTIATING WITH THE GOB FOR
AN ACCEPTABLE (TO THE MNR) OFFICIAL, MILITARY CANDIDATE.
REALISTICALLY SPEAKING, THE ARENA OF BATTLE FOR THE POLITICAL
PARTIES IS NOT THE PRESIDENCY, IT IS THE PARLIAMENT AND THE
FUTURE GOB, AND THE SHARES IN EACH THE PARTIES CAN WIN.
STEDMAN
