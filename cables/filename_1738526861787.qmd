# DEPARTMENT OF STATE TELEGRAM
**UNCLASSIFIED**

1. AS DEPARTMENTS OF STATE AND DEFENSE AWARE, GOB HAS EXPRESSED
STRONG INTEREST IN PURCHASING PROMPTLY TWO C-130 TRANSPORT
AIRCRAFT. PRESIDENT BANZER HAS MADE THIS INTEREST KNOWN TO ME
EXPLICITY. THE BOLIVIAN AIR FORCE HAS BEEN IN TOUCH WITH OUR
MILITARY MISSION ABOUT THESE AIRCRAFT. WHILE THE BOLIVIAN
AUTHORITIES WOULD PREFER NEW UNITS, THEY WOULD BE SATISFIED
WITH PROMPT DELIVERY OF USED EQUIPMENT PROVIDED, NATURALLY, IT
IS IN SERVICEABLE CONDITION. I HAVE JUST RECEIVED
PRICE AND AVAILABILITY DATA FOR NEW C-130 AIRCRAFT THROUGH U.S.
MILITARY CHANNELS INDICATING A COMPLETE PRICE PER UNIT OF
ABOUT $8 MILLION AND A DELIVERY TIME OF 1977. WE SHALL
APPRRIATELY INFORM THE BOLIVIAN AUTHORITIES OF THIS INFORMA-
TION WHICH WILL DISAPPOINT THEM AND ADDITIONALLY HEIGHTEN THEIR
INTEREST IN USED C-130 AIRCRAFT.


2. I WOULD THEREFORE APPRECIATE, ON AN URGENT BASIS, AN
AGGRESSIVE EFFORT BY STATE AND DEFENSE TO LOCATE TWO OR AT
LEAST ONE USED C-130 AIRCRAFT WHICH CAN BE OFFERED FOR PURCHASE
BY BOLIVIA AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. THE C-130 IS AN IDEAL TRANSPORT






 201513Z


AIRCRAFT FOR THIS COUNTRY FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND CIVIC




                   

                    

ACTION PURPOSES. THIS HAS BEEN AMPLY PROVEN IN THE PAST THROUGH
EFFECTIVE AIRLIFTS PROVIDED BOLIVIA BY C-130 AIRCRAFT
FROM SOUTHERN COMMAND. C-130'S HAVE MADE POSITIVE CONTRIBUTIONS
HERE IN AIRLIFTING CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE EQUIPMENT FROM
ONE AREA OF THE COUNTRY TO ANOTHER THROUGH WHICH NO OTHER
TRANSPORTATION MEANS AVAILABLE. DURING EMERGENCIES SUCH AS
ANNUAL FLOODING, WHEN RAIL AND ROAD TRANSPORT BROKEN, C-130
AIRLIFTS HAVE MOVED FOOD FROM STORAGE LOCATIONS TO POPULATION
CENTERS. BOLIVIA HAS, AS IS WELL KNOWN, A WEAK TRANSPORTATION
SYSTEM AT BEST, OVER SOME OF THE MOST DIFFICULT TERRAIN IN THE
WORLD. THE ADDITIONAL TRANSPORTATION CAPABILITY PROVIDED
BOLIVIA BY THE POSSESSION OF C-130 AIRCRAFT WOULD BE EXTREMELY
BENEFICIAL.


3. I URGE PROMPT ACTION TO MEET BOLIVIA'S DESIRES TO PURCHASE
C-130 AIRCRAFT FOR POLITICAL REASONS AS WELL. THE BENEFITS
TO THE U.S. FROM THE PRESENCE IN BOLIVIA OF A U.S. MANUFACTURED C-130
AIRCRAFT PROVING ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND CIVIC ACTION
ASSISTANCE WOULD BE GREAT. I BELIEVE THAT AT THE COST OF SOME
INTERNAL ADMINISTRATIVE EFFORT, WE CAN DERIVE SUBSTANTIAL
POLITICAL GAINS HERE.


4. IF USED C-130'S ARE BECOMING AVAILABLE FROM U.S. AIR
NATIONAL GUARD, I RECOMMEND ALLOCATION OF AT LEAST ONE FOR
BOLIVIA. IF THIS SOURCE IS NOT VIABLE, THEN I SINCERELY HOPE
MAXIMUM EFFORT WILL BE MADE TO LOCATE ANOTHER.


5. PLEASE ADVISE.
STEDMAN
