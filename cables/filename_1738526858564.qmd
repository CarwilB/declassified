1. CHARGE AND ADCM CALLED ON MINMINES LEMA JUNE 4 AT REQUEST OF
MINCOORDINATION CAPRILES. CHARGE EXPLAINED TO MINMINES THAT
FOLLOWING AMBASSADOR'S CALL ON MINMINES, EMBASSY HAD BEEN INSTRUCT-
ED RAISE MATTER WITH MINISTER CAPRILES (SEE REF A) WHO, AFTER
CONSULTING AND CONSIDERING FOR FEW DAYS HAD INFORMED CHARGE THAT
HE SHOULD SEEK MEETING WITH LEMA. CHARGE AGAIN PRESENTED POINTS
CONTAINED REF (B) AS HE HAD DONE IN MEETING WITH CAPRILES.
2. LEMA RESPONDED BY RHETORICALLY ASKING WHAT TYE WAS CLAIMING AND
WHAT HE WANTED. LEMA SAID HE HAD BEEN PAID MORE THAN HE
SHOULD HAVE BEEN PAID SO HE COULD NOT BE SEEKING MORE MONEY. SAID
MINISTRY OF MINES INITIALLY RECOMMENDED PAYMENT OF ONLY $US 700,000
AS VALUE OF EQUIPMENT, ETC., BUT, IN VIEW OF NEWNESS AND FRA-

GILITY OF BANZER GOVERNMENT AND "PRESSURE" FROM JOHN CONNOLLY ON




                        

                   

PRESIDENT BANZER, MORE LIBERAL INTER-MINISTERIAL ASSESSMENT ES-
TABLISHED ABOUT $US 1,350,000 AS VALUE WHICH WAS SUBSEQUENTLY
INCREASED (PRESUMABLY BY FINAL CABINET ACTION) TO ABOUT
$US 1,450,000. TYE HAD THEN SIGNED QUIT CLAIM.
3. MINISTER SAID TYE COULD NOT WANT RESTORATION OF MIXED ENTERPRISE
BECAUSE NEITHER COMIBOL NOR GOB WANTED TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH
TYE. MINISTER SAID TYE WAS BADLY BEHAVED (MAL CRIADO) INDIVIDUAL
WHO SO INCENSED SUBSECRETARY IN MINISTRY OF MINES THAT TYE WAS
SUBSEQUENTLY FORBIDDEN ENTRY TO THAT OFFICE.
4. LEMA SAID THERE WAS NO POINT TO ARBITRATION BECAUSE THERE WAS
NOTHING FOR TYE TO GAIN OUT OF IT. BESIDES, HE SAID, ARBIT-
RATION WAS POLITICALLY DANGEROUS FOR HIM AS MINISTER, FOR GOB AND
FOR U.S. --BOLIVIAN RELATIONS. SAID MIXED COMPANY HAD BEEN LEGALLY
DISSOLVED AFTER COMIBOL PAID ABOUT $US 23,000. IN REGISTRATION TAXES
TYE SHOULD HAVE PAID TO ESTABLISH MIXED COMPANY IN FIRST PLACE.
TYE FAILED TO PRESENT HIMSELF AT ANY OF EMBOSA BOARD MEETINGS
PRECEDING DISSOLUTION. ADCM ASKED WHETHER TYE'S LAWYER REQUESTED
ARBITRATION BEFORE DISSOLUTION. MINISTER SAID HE DID NOT KNOW,
BUT THAT AS MAJORITY STOCKHOLDER COMIBOL HAD RIGHT TO DISSOLVE
COMPANY ON PERFORMANCE GROUNDS SPECIFIED IN CONTRACT.
MINISTER NOTED THAT TYE FAILED BEAR HIS SHARE OPERATING
LOSSES RUNNING ABOUT $US 70,000 PER MONTH AND THAT HIS MINISTRY
HAD PREPARED $US 270,000 CLAIM AGAINST TYE WHICH INCLUDED TYE'S
SHARE OF REGISTRATION TAXES AND OPERATING LOSSES.
5. CHARGE SAID ARBITRATION NEED NOT BE PUBLIC AFFAIR BUT COULD
SERVE USEFUL PURPOSE OF CLEARING AIR. ASKED ADCM TO GIVE HIS
IMPRESSION OF WHAT TYE CLAIMED OR WANTED. ADCM SAID HE UNDERSTOOD
TYE HAD WANTED MINISTRY OF DEFENSE TO NOT EXERCISE ITS OPTION TO
TAKE 51 PERCENT OF SHARES IN GIBRALTAR HUARI-HUARI IN RETURN FOR
ASSUMPTION OF VARIOUS TYE DEBTS. SAID TYE MIGHT ALSO WANT SOME SORT
OF TAX BREAK IN CONNECTION WITH HIS NEW ARRANGEMENT WITH NEW
JERSEY ZINC. FINALLY, ALTHOUGH TYE HAD NOT CLEARLY PRESSED FOR IT,
HE MIGHT WANT 45 PERCENT SHARE (BASED ON HIS SHARE OF EMBOSA STOCK)
OF ANY NET ASSETS.
6. MINISTER SAID EMBOSA CHARTER CLEARLY STATES COMIBOL OWNS
ALL EQUIPMENT OF FIRM SO NOTHING TO SHARE. TYE WAS TO HAVE
45 PERCENT SHARE OF EQUITY IN RETURN FOR CONTRIBUTING FINANCING.
HIS PATENTED PROCESS WAS TO BECOME COMIBOL'S AFTER ONE YEAR.
7. MINISTER THEN SAID IMPC CONTRACT HAD BAD ODER FROM VERY
BEGINNING. CONTRACT HAD BEEN APPROVED DURING BARRIENTOS REGIME WHEN






 062219Z


PARLIAMENT WAS FUNCTIONING. TYE HAD GOTTEN CONTRACT APPROVED WITH
HELP OF INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL ALLIES. TORRES REGIME HAD NATION-
ALIZED EXTERPRISE AND BANZER REGIME HAD MADE GENEROUS SETTLEMENT.
TYE HAD BEEN UNABLE TO MEET REQUIREMENTS OF EMBOSA CHARTER, NOT
BECAUSE MANAGEMENT CONTRACT WAS NOT SIGNED, BUT BECAUSE TYE
WAS IN POOR FINANCIAL CONDITION. IBRD HAD BEEN READY AT ONE TIME
TO LEND UP TO $US 9 MILLION TO EMBOSA BUT TYE COULD NOT PUT UP HIS
PORTION OF FINANCING. TYE, IN FACT, OWED $US 1 MILLION TO PHILLIP




                   

                  

BROS. ($US 500,000 OF WHICH WAS REALLY OWED THROUGH PHILLIP BROS.
TO MITSUBISHI) AND HE STILL OWED SOME AMOUNT TO COMIGRA, ORIGINAL
OWNERS OF HUARI-HUARI. REPAYMENT OF TYE'S $US 200,000 DEBT TO
BANCO MINERO HAD BEEN POSTPONED FOR TWO YEARS BY MINDEFENSE OPTION
CONTRACT. THIS POSTPONEMENT WAS CONTRARY TO LAW, INJURED BANCO
MINERO, AND WAS ANOTHER GENEROUS FEATURE OF SETTLEMENT WITH TYE
WHEN HE WAS PAID $US 1,450,000. FINALLY, TYE HAD ARRANGED WITH NEW
JERSEY ZINC TO PAY DEBT TO BANCO MINERO FEW DAYS BEFORE EX-
PIRATION OF OPTION CONTRACT. MINISTER LEMA CLAIMED HE DID NOT KNOW
DETAILS OF TYE'S ARRANGEMENTS WITH NEW JERSEY ZINC OR LATTER'S
EFFORTS FORM MIXED COMPANY WITH PRIVATE BOLIVIAN COMPANIES TO EX-
PLOIT HUARI-HUARI MINE. LEMA WRYLY COMMENTED THAT OF $US 200,000 TYE
BORROWED FROM BANCO MINERO ONLY $US 30,000 TO $US 40,000 HAD BEEN
INVESTED IN DEVELOPMENT OF HUARI-HUARI WHICH WAS FAR RICHER MINE
THAN MINA MATILDE.
8. MINISTER NOTED THAT BOLIVIAN LAW REQUIRED THAT MINES OR
MINERAL DEPOSITS NOT BEING EXPLOITED OR WITHOUT DEVELOPMENT PLANS
MUST REVERT TO GOVERNMENT.
9. ADCM STATED THAT BESIDES CLEARING AIR, ARBITRATION MIGHT SERVE
TO AVOID ACTION MINISTER LEMA HAD MENTIONED IN EARLIER MEETING WHICH
TYE HAD THREATENED, I.E., TO BLOCKADE OR HOLD BOLIVIAN TIN SHIP-
MENT TO TEXAS SMELTER. MINISTER RESPONDED THAT TYE WAS NO BETTER
REGARDED IN U.S. THAN BOLIVIA DUE TO HIS ASSOCIATION WITH
FIRMS BROUGHT INTO BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS. MINISTER SAID
TYE WAS AN ADVENTURER WHO HAD USED CONTACTS TO ACCOMPLISH HIS
PURPOSES.
10. MINISTER CONCLUDED DISCUSSION BY REPEATING THAT HE SAW NO
BASIS FOR ARBITRATION OR SIMILAR PROCEEDINGS.
