# DEPARTMENT OF STATE TELEGRAM
**UNCLASSIFIED**

::: {.cable-meta}
:::


1. EMBASSY HAS HEARD FROM EXCELLENT SOURCE THAT THE VERY
INFORMAL MEETING IN LIMA BETWEEN VICTOR PAZ ESTENSSORO AND A
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE BANZER GOVERNMENT WAS SUCCESSFUL IN
DETERMINING THAT DR. PAZ IS WILLING TO DISCUSS TERMS WITH THE
PRESENT GOVERNMENT FOR HIS SUPPORT IN THE 1975 ELECTION. THE
GOB NOW PLANS TO SEND A HIGH-LEVEL PRESIDENTIAL ADVISOR TO
LIMA TO NEGOTIATE WITH PAZ FOR HIS EVENTUAL SUPPORT. IT IS
REASONABLY CLEAR FROM REMARKS MADE BY THE ABOVE SOURCE AND IN
FORMER CONVERSATIONS WITH PRESIDENTIAL ADVISORS ARCE AND CAPRILES
THAT PRESIDENT BANZER WILL NOT SEEK RE-ELECTION, BUT THAT BANZER
WANTS TO HAVE A DECISIVE VOICE IN CHOSING HIS SUCCESSOR AND
THEREFOR WANTS TO REMAIN IN OFFICE UNTIL THE ELECTIONS. WHILE
IT MAY BE PREMATURE TO SELECT A SUCCESSOR NOW, IT IS CLEAR
THAT AN ENDORSEMENT OF PAZ OF A SUCCESSOR CHOSEN BY BANZER AND
THE MILITARY HIERARCHY WOULD BE UNBEATABLE IN THE NEXT
ELECTIONS.
PARKER
