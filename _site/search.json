Since the mood in the armed forces is somewhat better than we had anticipated, our reply can be less heavy than we earlier considered. The main point should be to indicate to the Bolivian military that democratic government will be a significant boost to Bolivia’s chances to realize its economic, political and diplomatic objectives. Padilla wants to see me Tuesday night, but I could probably put this off to Wednesday night. Hopefully by then I would be able personally to deliver the President’s reply to Padilla.\nMy suggested draft reply (in paragraphs 4 to 9 below) presumes decisions and actions on two matters: a successful approach to Senator Hart to get him to delay reporting out a stockpile disposal bill until after the Senate’s August recess; and a decision on our delegation to the inauguration, which I hope can be headed by Mrs. Carter, if at all possible. The proposed commitment not to sell tin in 1979 is not really a separate policy decision, since if the Congressional authorization is delayed to September, the normal consultation process will delay sales until 1980 in any event.\nBegin suggested draft letter. Dear Mr. President. I have taken to heart your thoughtful letter of July 6, in which you raise your concerns regarding U.S. tin policy and its relationship to Bolivia’s return to constitutional, elected government. I appreciate your raising these concerns with me in the cordial and open manner that is a hallmark of U.S. - Bolivian relations.\nFirst of all, Mr. President, let me congratulate you and Bolivian armed forces for your stalwart leadership in returning your country to democratic rule–a venture which has captured the imagination and admiration of my country and Bolivia’s friends everywhere. The successful completion of this hopeful process with the August 6 inauguration will place Bolivia firmly among the democratic countries of our hemisphere and enhance Bolivia’s international standing and capacity to achieve its economic, political and diplomatic objectives.\nOn the matter of tin, let me assure you that the United States will manage any eventual disposals so as to safeguard against disruption of the tin market and the economic position of producers, including Bolivia. In response to your letter, the White House has contacted Senator Hart who, in recognition of Bolivia’s return to constitutional rule, has agreed to postpone Senate action on stockpile legislation until after the Senate’s August recess. This should assure that no dramatic news on tin occurs during the final stage of Bolivia’s efforts to complete the election process in your Congress. I can also assure you that no tin sales will take place in 1979, when Bolivia’s elected government is developing and implementing a program to stabilize the country’s economy. Any sales plans in 1980 will be developed on the basis of full consultation with Bolivia’s new, elected government, as well as with other producers, and will be designed to the best of our abilities to avoid depressing the export earnings Bolivia’s new government will need for its stabilization effort. You can also rest assured that my government will work through the international financial institutions and with Bolivia’s new government to help that government raise the financial support necessary to back a sound stabilization program.\nI am aware of your country’s plans to raise the issue of Bolivia’s aspiration for access to the sea at the OAS General Assembly meeting this October in La Paz. You know from my remarks to the OAS last year of my personal interest in this question. We will now be awaiting Bolivia’s definition of an approach to this issue with every desire to be supportive wherever we can.\nTo express as clearly as possible to the Bolivian people our goodwill and deep appreciation of the country’s orderly return to constitutional rule, I am asking my wife Rosalyn (alternate choice) to represent me at the inauguration of Bolivia’s new President on August 6.\nAs, Mr. President, approach the final stage of Bolivia’s return to constitutional rule, a process which you have so steadfastly overseen, let me wish Bolivia full success in this historic venture, and to you personally all the best in the future. End of suggested draft letter.\nThe President’s reply to Padilla would be most effective if I could have it in time to deliver personally by P.M. Wednesday July 11.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1979LAPAZ05838\nDate: July 08, 1979\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 20 Mar 2014\nConcepts: DEMOCRACY, POLICIES, TIN, DIPLOMATIC COMMUNICATIONS, ELECTIONS, STOCKPILE DISPOSAL, ACCESS TO PORTS"

The new budget, following approval of the first supplemental appropriations in a Cabinet meeting of February 9, provides for a deficit 41 percent greater than that planned for 1978, and 87 percent greater than the actual 1978 deficit. Although Alba is taking a hard line on salary increases, it does not appear that there is political support for other measures demanded by the IMF, particularly fuel prices increases.\nLacking credits from the IMF, the Bolivian government must obtain loans from other sources to cover its balance of payments deficit. In addition, it will presumably attempt to renegotiate a portion of the debt that falls due during 1979. While financing may be expensive, we believe that sufficient credits can be obtained to avoid a financial crisis before August. End summary.\nPlanning Minister Gary Prado’s visit to the United States does not appear to have generated additional support within the Padilla government for economic measures. It is highly unlikely that stabilization measures which would facilitate an agreement with the International Monetary Fund will be introduced before the July elections. Although the Minister of Finance has announced an austerity budget, information we have obtained from government sources indicates that the budget may not be quite so tough as its publicity suggests. We do not have a breakdown of the budget, which does not include the public corporations, but the following table summarizes 1978 projected and actual results, and compares them with projections for 1979 adjusted to reflect supplementary expenditures approved by the Cabinet February 9.\n  BUDGETED        ACTUAL      BUDGETED\n  1978       1978      1979\nINCOME 9,288 8,454.7 10,549.4 EXPENSES 11,656.1 10,248.1 13,896.1 SURPLUS (DEFICIT) (2,368.1) (1,793.4) (3,346.7)\n\nNotes: 1. All figures in millions of Bolivians pesos. Exchange rate is 20 pesos to US$ 1. 2. Following the approval of 700 million pesos in additional expenditures at the Cabinet meeting of February 9, the internal GOB document from which we obtained these figures contains a comment to the effect that it will be impossible in 1979 to reduce the consolidated public sector deficit below 12 percent of Gross Domestic Product. This statement indicates that another large balance of payments deficit should be expected in 1979 (a preliminary Ministry of Finance estimate puts the 1979 balance of payments deficit at $184 million), and that large amounts of financing and refinancing will be necessary this year.\n\nFinancial officials have recently been jolted by the withdrawal of $21 million credit offer received from a German bank in late 1978 (believed to be the Westdeutsche Landisches Bank). GOB authorities had signed a promissory note for the loan, but had not formalized an agreement. On the basis of the note, a bridge credit was obtained, with the understanding that a formal loan agreement would be signed early in 1979. The German bank has now retracted its offer, apparently because of concern about the Bolivian economic situation, and the GOB must now repay or roll over the $21 million short-term bridge credit.\nDespite the failure of this particular transaction, the Padilla government should be able to obtain the funds that it requires to keep the economy afloat until August 1979. We have learned from usually reliable sources that COMIBOL is currently considering a series of major general purpose loan offers, including one of $100 million for short-term (180 day) working capital, and three others of $90, $60 and $80 million at longer (5-8 year) terms. American Express and Librabank, in which Chase Manhattan has a financial interest, are known to be among the banks offering these credits. It is doubtful that all of these transactions could be realized, but in view of the fact that COMIBOL credit requirements are thought to be less than $140 million, a combination might be worked out that would allow some of the funds to be used for balance of payments support. We have also learned that the Central Bank has received an offer of $70 million from Wells Fargo Bank.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1979LAPAZ01469\nDate: February 17, 1979\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 jan 1960\nConcepts: FINANCIAL CRISIS"

Nonetheless, OPIC will wish to inspect text of note carefully (Embassy translating and pouching) to see if language adequately constitutes foreign government approval since language of note only implies that Min Ag’s approval constitutes GOB approval. In fact, note goes on to further inform OPIC that details of investments must still be approved by GOB’s Institute of National Investment (INI).\nThis is first GOB action approving new OPIC coverage in several years. Foreign Ministry Economic Office aware of OPIC needs and INI has just established Office of Foreign Private Investment which Embassy is attempting to educate in OPIC matters. If OPIC has suggestion for change in approval format, we will discuss with these offices.\nWhile recognizing potential advantage to Bolivian economy of investment by experienced U.S. cattlemen, Embassy concerned re Bolivia’s history of land tenure disputes and therefore advises that any OPIC insurance contract covering U.S. agricultural investment should carefully define conditions of land tenure being insured and insurance should only be extended to investment in land whose title has been fully cleared by procedure provided by Bolivian law. Insurance should also carefully define character and purposes of investment. This important caveat applies to Lessor and Stokes investments plus pending applications of Clair Peterson and Verne Hutchinson. (Latter’s local contact, Warren Young, told EMBOFF that Hutchinson has decided not, repeat not, to go ahead with investment here.)\nLong-term dispute over Applegate-Youngquist land expropriation illustrates potential difficulties which can arise out of Agrarian Reform Law of Bolivia’s 1952 Revolution. Law has frequently resulted, according to practices of past governments, in lengthy legal disputes over titles and outright land expropriations. Law provides for compensation of expropriations in 25-year, 2 percent bonds, but we are told that no, repeat no, such compensation has ever been given. Land titles can be confirmed (given “inafectabilidad”) by several step legal process ending in decree signed by Bolivian President. Law also limits size of private land holdings according to character of investment and land’s location and use. As we read law “large-scale”, “modern enterprises” investing in livestock production in the tropical Beni area must be no larger than 50,000 hectares and have at least one head of cattle for each five hectares. In contrast large enterprise investing in agricultural production in same area would be limited to 2,000 hectares.\nLessor and Stokes’ local attorney states that each investor intends to buy approximately 10,000 hectares in Beni and he foresees each having more than 2,000 head necessary to meet one to five hectares requirement. He correctly notes that Agrarian Reform has resulted in few expropriations in lightly populated Beni and that present GOB has shown no, repeat no, penchant for further land expropriations and has improved administration of law somewhat. On other hand, attorney states that, as with many land parcels in country, those being considered for purchase by Lessor and Stokes have not yet received confirmation by presidential decree. He mentioned that investors contemplating eventually expanding from meat production to processing and canning.\nEmbassy notes that even in Beni Agrarian Reform has resulted in many title disputes, if not expropriations, and this likely to continue as population and economic activity now increasing. Moreover, present agrarian policies may last only as long as present government. Thus, Embassy sees need to take all possible steps to secure title and decree establishing “inafectabilidad” before issuing OPIC insurance. Insurance contract should also guard against a change in character of investment or use of land that might open it up for challenge under Agrarian Reform Law.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1974LAPAZ02766\nDate: April 30, 1974\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 JAN 1960\nConcepts: INSURANCE, CATTLE, NATIONALIZATION, INVESTORS, FOREIGN INVESTMENTS, CONTRACTS, LAND REFORMS"

End Summary.\n        \n                    \n          TAGS:\n          EFIN, EMIN, BL\n        \n                  \n    \n    \n  \n\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE TELEGRAM\nUNCLASSIFIED\n\nLumping Bolivia together with other oil exporters such as Venezuela in one sentence in the summary as standing to increase oil earnings by US$ 7 billion is very misleading as it gives the impression that Bolivia has a significant share in the US$ 7 billion, whereas actually Venezuela accounts for about US$ 6 billion and Bolivia only about US$ 100 million.\nTable on page 8 shows Bolivia’s petroleum export earnings increasing by US$ 200 million in 1974. It is extremely unlikely that Bolivia’s total petroleum export earnings will reach that amount. As laid out in La Paz A-23, Bolivian petroleum exports totalled only about 11,840,000 barrels in 1973 and earnings were only about US$ 48.0 million. We do not believe petroleum export volume can expand very much as proven reserves are quite limited. We estimate volume will increase by only about 7 percent to 12,700,000 barrels in 1974. At a price of US$ 12.10 per barrel, this volume would generate US$ 153.7 million in earnings and at US$ 15.50 per barrel US$ 196.9 million. The latter average price looks increasingly unlikely for 1974.\nTable I of Ref A shows Bolivia producing about 16 million barrels and consuming five million barrels in 1972. This agrees with our data for 1972.\nWe believe increased prices for imports including freight and handling will reduce gain to Bolivia considerably, not slightly. Moreover, net gain to Bolivia is diminished because of the Gulf Settlement which requires that 25 percent of export volume from former Gulf properties will be used to pay off indemnity. We estimate this payment will be at least US$ 20 million in 1974.\nOur Balance of Payments best estimate (La Paz A-23) may be somewhat optimistic as we had estimated the payment to Gulf at only US$ 14 million. Thus, a US$ 11.4 million surplus may be only about US$ 5 million and even this may be too optimistic if some of the financing contained in the loan disbursement table is not realized. Only if oil prices remain close to US$ 15 per barrel and if mineral prices remain near recent highs will a more favorable outcome of a strong surplus be realized.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1974LAPAZ01390\nDate: March 08, 1974\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 JAN 1960\nConcepts: PETROLEUM, NATIONAL INCOME, EXPORT PRICES"

Yields per hectare should average 8.5 QQ, which compares with 12.0 QQ for 1978. ADEPA estimates that 34,500 hectares were planted for this 1979 season.\nEXPORTATION: ADEPA estimates that 195,304 QQ of cotton will be exported and that Bolivia will receive $US 9,677,250. In 1978 exports totaled 304,279 QQ, which represented export revenues of $US 14,317,248. To this date, ADEPA has sold 15,000 bales to Bunge, an English firm, at a price of $US 50/QQ FOB Santa Cruz. Higher transportation costs will increase export costs of this year’s cotton crop. The railroad link between Santa Cruz, the center of cotton production, and the port of Santos, Brazil was severely damaged by flooding and has not been repaired. Cotton exports will begin in early May and must go through Rosario, Argentina until the Brazilian railroad link is temporarily restored sometime in early June.\nDOMESTIC DEMAND: This is estimated to increase from 73,655 QQ in 1978 to 97,946 QQ and generating US$ 4,897,300.\nCOMMENT: The untimely fall in cotton production will aggravate Bolivia’s already serious balance of payments problems. An important non-traditional export, cotton represented 2 percent of total exports and 17 percent of non-traditional exports in 1978.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1979LAPAZ04006\nDate: May 08, 1979\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 jan 1960\nConcepts: COTTON, CROP DESTRUCTION, PRODUCTION DATA"

HUMBOLDT REPORTEDLY TELEPHONED THE LOCAL NEWSPAPERS, PRETENDING TO BE MNR EXECUTIVE SECRETARY RUBEN JULIO, AND ANNOUNCED THAT “IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENTS” WOULD BE ANNOUNCED AT MNR HEADQUARTERS. HUMBOLDT HIMSELF THEN STEPPED OUT OF A TAXI IN FRONT OF THE MNR BUILDING AT PRECISELY 4 P.M., WEARING A BEARD AND DRESSED IN A HAT AND DARK CLOTHES, AND ENTERED TO READ A STATEMENT TO THE PRESS.\nHUMBOLDT’S STATEMENT AND SUBSEQUENT COMMENTS TO NEWSMEN ARE LARGELY A DEFENSE OF HIS OWN ACTIONS FROM 1971 TO THE PRESENT. CLAIMING THAT HIS ENEMIES USED THE JUNE 5 COUP ATTEMPT AS A PRETEXT TO REMOVE HIM FROM THE SCENE, HUMBOLDT ASKED THAT THE PROOFS OF HIS INVOLVEMENT IN THE YOUNG OFFICERS’ REVOLT BE MADE PUBLIC. AT THE SAME TIME, HUMBOLDT REITERATED HIS CLAIM TO BE THE ACTING NATIONAL CHIEF OF THE MNR; HE DESCRIBED DR. VICTOR PAZ ESTENSSORO AS THE TRUE CHIEF OF THE PARTY AND ADMITTED TO HAVING MET WITH PAZ IN LIMA PRIOR TO HIS OWN CLANDESTINE RETURN TO BOLIVIA. FOLLOWING THE PRESS CONFERENCE, HUMBOLDT LEFT\n\n292229Z\nMNR HEADQUARTERS AND DEPARTED AS HE HAD COME, IN A TAXI.\n\nGOVERNMENT AND OFFICIAL MNR REACTION TO HUMBOLDT’S SUDDEN RE-APPEARANCE WERE NOT LONG IN COMING. A MINISTRY OF INTERIOR COMMUNIQUE ANNOUNCED THAT THE MINISTRY WOULD DETAIN HUMBOLDT FOR HAVING ENTERED THE COUNTRY ILLEGALLY. THE COMMUNIQUE ALSO ACCUSED HIM OF HAVING RETURNED SOLELY TO PROMOTE HIS OWN PERSONAL INTERESTS WITHIN THE MNR. ACTING MNR CHIEF GUILLERMO FORTUN AND OTHER HIGH PARTY OFFICIALS ALSO CRITICIZED HUMBOLDT’S ACTION IN RETURNING TO BOLIVIA. IN A BRIEF COMMUNIQUE, THE MNR HIGH COMMAND AGAIN ACCUSED HUMBOLDT OF INVOLVEMENT IN THE JUNE 5 COUP ATTEMPT, AND CHARGED THAT HE HAD VOLUNTARILY ABANDONED HIS POST AS ACTING PARTY CHIEF TO ATTEMPT THE OVERTHROW OF THE BANZER GOVERNMENT.\nTHE EMBASSY HAS BEEN INFORMED THAT HUMBOLDT WAS TAKEN INTO CUSTODY BY OFFICIALS OF THE MINISTRY OF INTERIOR ON THE MORNING OF AUGUST 29.\nCOMMENT: SPECULATION IS RUNNING HIGH AS TO THE MOTIVES FOR HUMBOLDT’S BRIEF BUT SPECTACULAR RE-EMERGENCE ON THE BOLIVIAN POLITICAL SCENE. ONE POSSIBILITY, WHICH SEEMS UNLIKELY IN OUR VIEW, IS THAT HUMBOLDT RETURNED TO LEAD OR TAKE PART IN A NEW CONSPIRACY AGAINST THE BANZER GOVERNMENT. ANOTHER, MORE LIKELY, EVENTUALITY IS THAT HUMBOLDT SET OUT ON HIS RETURN TRIP TO BOLIVIA WITH THE INTENTION OF MAKING A SURPRISE APPEARANCE AT THE MNR CONVENTION, ORIGINALLY SCHEDULED TO BEGIN ON AUGUST 28. HOWEVER, WHEN HE ARRIVED IN BOLIVIA AND DISCOVERED THAT THE CONVENTION HAD BEEN POSTPONED AT THE LAST MOMENT, TO SEPTEMBER 27, HE DECIDED TO STAGE A PUBLIC RE-APPEARANCE AS THE BEST WAY OF SAVING THE SITUATION. A RELATED CONSIDERATION IS THE POSSIBILITY OF A PAZ-HUMBOLDT UNDERSTANDING IN LIMA, WHERE-BY HUMBOLDT AGREED TO MAKE HIS CLANDESTINE RETURN TO BOLIVIA AS PART OF APLAN TO FURTHER WEAKEN THE POSITION OF GUILLERMO FORTUN. FORTUN HAS APPEARED, IN RECENT WEEKS, TO BE INCREASINGLY OUT OF FAVOR WITH BOTH THE BANZER GOVERNMENT AND A MAJORITY OF THE MNR’S MILITANTS. WHATEVER THE LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF HUMBOLDT’S RETURN, HE IS LIKELY NOW TO BE QUICKLY BUNDLED OFF INTO PRISON OR EXILE BY GOB SECURITY\n\n292229Z\nOFFICIALS, WHO ARE PRESUMABLY EMBARRASSED BY THE THEATRICAL MANNER IN WHICH THE FORMER MNR LEADER MADE KNOWN HIS RENEWED PRESENCE IN BOLIVIA.

He referred to CIECC meeting in Barbados and criticized US for not having co-sponsored the resolution of Bridgetown which 22 others adhered to. He expressed his opinion that the US left grave doubts as regards its true intentions towards the future of the voluntary funds. In the same vein Forde added that security was not provided by military expenditure alone, and felt that the US, being the most powerful country, could not escape its responsibility to contribute to equitable development in the region. He was followed by Ecuador’s Subsecretary of Foreign Relations, Mario Alleman and Paraguay’s Fonmin, Albert Nogues, who gave very general presentation.\nCommittee 2 on economic affairs completed discussions on agenda items dealing with trade issues with lengthy but relatively moderate debate on protectionism. On discussion of GSP exclusion of OPEC countries, Venezuela remained silent and Ecuador cited objections to conclusion of bilateral agreement with US. Bolivia made a relatively mild statement about adverse effects of US tin disposal. US responded with exposition on tin prices since 1972 and on production falling behind consumption. Indication is that Bolivia does not intend to table a resolution on tin.\nOnly substantive resolutions tabled thus far, not yet discussed, are one by Ecuador on Panama Canal tolls, calling for continued OAS study on negative impact on Latin American trade, and resolution by Costa Rica expressing Latin American concern over pending meat import legislation and asking USG to find long-term solutions that will not restrict meat imports from Latin America and the Caribbean.\nThird committee met in afternoon for first working session and completed consideration of the resolutions of 1978 CIECC of Santiago and the 1979 CIECC of Barbados. On the resolution of Bridgetown the US delegate referred to the position of the US against language implying commitment to 66 percent contribution. The US delegate also stated that the resolution contradicted the “voluntary” nature of the funds in its reference to a “proportion” for FEMCIECC. The delegate of Barbados acknowledged that in fact a kind of informal quota had been operating with regard to FEMCIECC. No other delegation spoke to the issue and the resolution was passed by consensus with the US reserving as was the case in Bridgetown. A working group was formed, including the US, to draft a resolution which would instruct the Secretariat and CEPCIECC to develop alternative criteria and procedures to achieve the goals of the resolution of Bridgetown.\nCommittee 1 started substantive business with consideration of IAHRC annual report. USDEL made statement of strong support for Commission’s work and we are preparing draft resolution in close coordination with IAHRC Chairman Aguilar. We expect work on this item to continue tomorrow after which El Salvador human rights report will be considered. Venezuelan and Salvadorean reps are developing appropriate resolution on this item which we will co-sponsor.\nDeclaration of La Paz. A working group was set up to revise the proposal of the Andean Group. Mexican Ambassador De La Colina called for a total redrafting to focus on principles and goals for the Inter-American system. Brazil, Chile, Argentina joined Mexico and US in pressing for the elimination of references to specific problems like Bolivia’s access to the sea and tin. US and Brazil were the only delegations with specific language changes to present. Working group meets again tomorrow to consider new draft with changes proposed in today’s session.\nBolivia’s access to the sea. GOB is lining up co-sponsors for its resolution. Corridor talk indicates that several countries are urging language changes as conditions for their support and that drafts by other delegations are also circulating.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1979LAPAZ09150\nDate: October 26, 1979\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 jan 1960\nConcepts: REGIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, MEETING PROCEEDINGS"

I did not raise transportation problems with President Banzer when I spoke to him at 2:30 p.m. this afternoon. We have informed GOB that we wish to help in request for ammunition and that sale is approved. We have informed authorities of difficulties in arranging official US air transportation. We have told them that if US transports material payment would have to be arranged for by Bolivian authorities.\nBolivians have informed US they are unable to airlift cargo from Canal Zone to La Paz. Apart from normal problems in flying from La Paz to Panama with older aircraft, they have unfulfilled internal airlift requirements in present emergency. They have repeated their request for our assistance in bringing the cargo in and have assured us again that there will be no publicity.\nChief US Air Force mission believes airlift of cargo from Zone to Bolivia is beyond Bolivian Air Force capability. In his opinion it would probably take more than two weeks for Bolivia to bring in ammunition and it would have to be done on a slow shuttle basis. He also reports Bolivians might have difficulties in acquiring clearances in neighboring countries for landing for refueling purposes with an ammunition cargo.\nIn view of foregoing would appreciate assistance from State and Defense on arrangements for official US transport of cargo to La Paz.

This is probably a natural development from the current burst of Bolivian interest in regaining a seacoast and also Bolivian recognition of the diplomatic skills of Secretary Kissinger. I sense some views within the Foreign Ministry that the USG might, for example, ask the foreign ministers of Chile, Peru and Bolivia to meet together on the subject of an outlet to the sea at some time during the forthcoming meeting in Washington.\nSince I have not had this possibility put to me formally I have not been able to deal with it directly. However, I have used some recent opportunities to restate our present policy of hoping that Bolivia, through diplomatic negotiations with Chile and Peru, can achieve its objective. This is an indirect way of stating that it is not now the policy of the USG to involve itself in this issue. I hope to preclude any formal request for our assistance which might be rejected as this could conceivably cause a very adverse reaction at the present time when all Bolivians are vocalizing an emotional interest in a return to the sea.\nI would be most appreciative for your views on this subject, especially if you sense that there is any possibility that the USG might consider some form of good offices to assist Bolivia. It would be most helpful if I could have your views by Monday, April 8 as it is quite likely that I will have opportunities, informal and formal, to see senior Ministry officials before their departure for Washington, now tentatively planned for either the 13th or 14th of April.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1974LAPAZ02085\nDate: April 04, 1974\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 28 MAY 2004\nConcepts: MEETINGS, WATERWAY ACCESS"

The letter also indicates the GOB will seek EFF credit at the conclusion of Standby in late 1980. The Finance Minister also believes the World Bank is committed to providing a program loan once the Standby is approved by IMF and he plans to approach IBRD President McNamara accordingly. End summary.\nAfter receiving informal approval by the IMF on December 24, Bolivian Finance Minister Augusto Cuadros Sanchez signed late December 27 a formal letter of intent requesting the IMF to provide a Standby and indicating that at the termination of the Standby the GOB will request a credit from the Extended Fund Facility. The letter was accompanied by a memorandum on GOB economic policy over the four-year period 1980 through 1983, a technical memorandum of understanding with several tables, and a separate short letter requesting a Trust Fund drawing. According to local IMF representative Jorge Sol Perez, the Fund will give formal approval to the Standby and the Trust Fund drawing in mid-January.\nThe Standby request is for 66.375 million SDRs, while the Trust Fund drawing request is estimated conservatively at 15 million SDRs, for a total of 81.4 SDRs or about 105.8 million dollars. Sol Perez estimates that, because of the rising price of gold, the Trust Fund drawing will more likely be in the neighborhood of 20 million SDRs and therefore that the total will be closer to 86.4 SDRs or 112.3 million dollars. Disbursements (using the more conservative estimate of the Trust Fund drawing) will be as follows:\n\nJANUARY 1980 41.4 SDR MARCH 1980 14.0 SDR JUNE 1980 13.0 SDR SEPT 1980 13.0 SDR TOTAL 81.4 SDR\nThe GOB would expect to receive the first tranche of the EFF credit in January 1981.\n\nCuadros Sanchez’s memorandum on economic policy analyzes Bolivia’s current economic problems and their origins, defends the economic measures already taken by the GOB and describes additional measures to be taken in the future. The object of the GOB’s efforts in 1980, according to the memorandum, is “to create the bases to achieve sustained economic growth during subsequent years” and therefore “to put public finances and the administration of monetary instruments in order and to establish regulations and controls over public-sector external debt operations, with the purpose of reducing the balance of payments deficit.” For the 1981-1983 period, the economic program’s objective will be “to achieve and maintain an acceptable level of economic growth in real terms, avoiding inflationary pressures and seeking to strengthen still further the balance of payments.” An acceptable level of economic growth is defined as four-and-a-half to five percent annual growth in the Gross Internal Product, compared with the two percent reportedly registered in 1979. The memorandum notes that among the objectives for 1980 will be a “viable” exchange rate, reduction of the overall public sector deficit, rationalization of public investment, adjustment of the prices of public-sector goods and services to realistic levels, and control of the external debt of the public sector and the private banking system. The memorandum strongly implies the possibility of future devaluation of the peso by stating that, “in the future the value of the peso will be determined by the behavior of the Bolivian economy, particularly the International Reserve position of the Central Bank and the relationships between external and internal costs.”\nIn addition, the memorandum notes, the administration will present to the Congress in 1980 tax reform legislation intended to stimulate economic growth and increase public sector revenues. Specifically, according to Cuadros Sanchez, the GOB will broaden the coverage of taxes on profits, introduce some new indirect taxes, reduce drastically exemptions from import duties, maintain a rate of expansion in the money supply which conforms to the projected growth of private sector savings and to balance of payments objectives, establish new incentives for savings and modify the taxation of the mining sector to promote increased investment and production. The GOB will not, says Cuadros Sanchez, impose any more restrictions in 1980 on international payments and transfers nor will it tighten present restrictions, if such actions would violate the IMF’s prescriptions. He expects that during the first semester of 1980 the GOB will be current on its external debt service.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1979LAPAZ10988\nDate: December 29, 1979\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 jan 1960\nConcepts: FINANCIAL AGREEMENTS, IMF DRAWING RIGHTS, FINANCIAL PROGRAMS"

An otherwise harmonious opening day was marred only by remarks in Prado’s statement concerning loss of its coastal land and the development constraints which stem from that loss, and his accusing the US of “economic aggression” directed towards Bolivia through sales of tin from our strategic stockpile.\nThe first two agenda items concerned election of officers, and adoption of the agenda and organization of work of the 18th Session. Without objection, the make-up of the board was established as follows: Chairman-Gary Prado (Bolivia), 1st Vice Chairman-Victor Barrelo (Mexico), 2nd Vice Chairman-Ludwing Zuiverloon (Suriname), Rapporteur-Wilburg Castro (Costa Rica). The provisional agenda, issued March 6, was adopted with a modification calling for a separate committee to be formed to deal with water-related activities. Accordingly, three committees were established. Committee I will address agenda items III and IV, convening respectively, the economic and social development and external economic relations of Latin America, and cooperation among developing countries and regions. Committee II will deal with agenda item five, activities of the ECLA system since the 17th Session and program of work for the period 1979-81. Committee III, as stated, will consider regional coordination in actions related to water. Boards were selected for all committees but Committee III, where it was agreed committee members would select their own officers. Committee I officers were selected as follows: Chairman-Ecuador, 1st Vice Chairman-Cuba, 2nd Vice Chairman-Argentina, Rapporteur-Venezuela. Committee II officers are: Chairman-Peru, 1st Vice Chairman-Jamaica, 2nd Vice Chairman-Uruguay, Rapporteur-Brazil.\nIglesias’ brief opening remarks called for a strong ECLA role in galvanizing a unified Latin American view of the appropriate development strategy as the Third Development Decade approaches. He pointed out that the world economic situation is fraught with uncertainties, and that enhanced cooperation among the developing countries would moderate some of those problems. He urged particular attention to agenda item four, which he hoped would result in a strong follow-on to the Buenos Aires Plan of Action for Technical Cooperation among Developing Countries (TCDC), established in September, 1978.\nAs host to the session, Bolivia’s Planning Minister Prado gave the keynote address which began with a litany on the stages of Bolivian economic and social development since the country’s independence. He claimed that Bolivia’s status as one of the region’s poorest countries would be different had what he said was its richest land and access to the sea not been plundered (by Chile in the 1879 War of the Pacific). Probably forewarned of Prado’s remarks, the Chilean delegation did not attend the inaugural session. Prado noted that Bolivia’s economic growth rate did not begin to equal those of its neighbors until the 1960s and 70s, although he decried the fact that the benefits of that growth were unequally distributed. The task of Bolivia, and the rest of Latin America, in the next decade, he said, was to emphasize equity, a consideration overlooked in the past two decades when the pursuit of growth dominated development strategy. The obligation to move away from the strategy which encouraged the misuse of scarce capital and luxury consumption, to one encouraging mass employment and widening of consumption throughout the population, is one which rests primarily with individual governments, Prado averred. But he also mentioned the role which external capital and the TNCs have to play in equitable development. He felt TNCs had not always operated in the best interests of developing countries; claiming that the region’s mineral resources were underexplored, he blamed that on TNCs which traditionally controlled investments in the extractive industries. In order to realize Latin America’s mineral potential, Prado proposed the creation of a regional fund to finance investments in the minerals sector, and urged ECLA to undertake a study to determine the feasibility of such a fund, and how it might coordinate its activities with other international institutions. (Comment: We expect the Bolivian delegation to introduce a resolution to this effect in Committee I. End comment.) In the context of the importance of minerals to Bolivia’s economy, Prado castigated the US for what he termed economic aggression in manipulating the world prices of commodities, alluding to an expected sale from US tin stocks. Since Bolivia is moving towards democratic elections and is trying to improve the welfare of its poor, Prado wondered out loud how US actions on tin can be reconciled with avowed US espousal of human rights and democracy.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1979LAPAZ03447\nDate: April 19, 1979\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 jan 1960\nConcepts: MEETING PROCEEDINGS, REGIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, ORGANIZATION & MANAGEMENT"

Immediately afterward, Col. Natusch, appearing on national television, formally resigned.\nAt approximately 8:05 PM Ms. Gueiler took the oath of office on the floor of the Congress. After congressmen and spectators sang a verse of the national anthem, she gave a brief, emotional address recalling her 30 years of “patriotic struggle” as a “revolutionary woman” and pledging to defend the Congress and the Constitution.\nGueiler, about 60 years old, was one of the founding members of the Nationalist Revolutionary Movement (MNR). After the 1952 Revolution, she held a position in the Ministry of Labor, and in 1960 she served as a congressional deputy. She subsequently joined Juan Lechin to form the labor-oriented Party of the Revolutionary Left (PRIN). In the late 1970s, when the PRIN became schismatic, she established her own party faction. In the 1979 elections, she was a member of Victor Paz Estenssoro’s MNR alliance; Edwin Moeller, a former husband, headed a second PRIN faction which supported Hernan Siles’ UDP. Ms. Gueiler has a grown daughter, and a grandchild who is currently studying at a university in Florida.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1979LAPAZ09940\nDate: November 17, 1979\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 jan 1960\nConcepts: PRESIDENT, INTERIM GOVERNMENT, POLITICAL SETTLEMENT"

This firm is Bolivia’s representative for Fiat-Concord, which is installing a tractor assembly plant in Cochabamba (see Refair) which will have a monopoly in the Bolivian market on certain sizes of tractors. Two local banks report that the firm has a good financial reputation and meets obligations promptly. A third bank reports that the firm has a well managed checking account but reports no credit experience. A fourth La Paz bank reports that the firm in the past was slow to pay on occasion but that its present obligations are met regularly. The firm itself reports paid-in capital the equivalent of US$ 34,000 and 1972 sales the equivalent of US$ 2 million. The firm is recommended as a good trade contact.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1974LAPAZ00060\nDate: January 04, 1974\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 JAN 1960\nConcepts: n/a"

DCM stated that Washington authorities were of the view that procedure earlier outlined by Ledezma (La Paz 0712) seemed to be indistinguishable from formal extradition request, particularly need to channel documents through Foreign Office. DCM inquired whether Ledezma viewed his procedure as, in effect, an extradition procedure and whether Foreign Office channel could not be omitted. Ledezma replied that he did not regard procedure earlier outlined as formal extradition route. Rather, Foreign Office channel seemed to him to be required only in order that signature of Bolivian Consul in New York could be duly certified by Foreign Ministry. (Ledezma had not earlier mentioned need for Bolivian consul certification). When pressed as to the real need for use of Foreign Office channel, Ledezma agreed that this could be dropped and the relevant documents submitted directly to him. Assuming that documents are in good order, he would then authorize issuance of an arrest warrant for Penaranda. It was clear in the conversation with Ledezma that he views the documents as legally necessary to support issuance of an arrest warrant against a Bolivian citizen.\nLedezma then stated that it would be necessary for the new Minister of Interior, Juan Pereda Asbun to be briefed by the Embassy on the case and the Minister’s assent obtained to turning Penaranda over to USG jurisdiction. Minister Pereda has told Ambassador he wishes to discuss in private matters of current interest soon, perhaps next week. Ambassador will then take up Penaranda case and other matters. Embassy has no reason to believe that Minister Pereda will raise objections to procedure outlined by Ledezma.\nEmbassy believes that with Ledezma’s having dropped the Foreign Ministry requirement, objections raised in reftel have been overcome. What Ledezma now agrees to is in effect an informal procedure whereby Penaranda can be delivered to US jurisdiction. We have very carefully considered what complications might arise if we follow the new procedure outlined by Ledezma. Assuming Minister Pereda’s concurrence, we foresee none. If, however, complications should arise subsequent to the presentation of the documents to Ledezma, we still believe it would be fairly easy to back-off, should such be necessary to avoid jeopardizing Bolivian narcotics cooperation.\nAction requested: Embassy requests that the following documents be obtained from New York court authorities and transmitted to Embassy for delivery to Ledezma:\n\nCertified copy of arrest warrant against Jose Kenneth Penaranda, with accompanying Spanish translation, all legalized by Bolivian Consul.\nCertified copy of indictment of Jose Kenneth Penaranda, with Spanish translation, all legalized by the Bolivian Consul.\n\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1974LAPAZ01434\nDate: March 08, 1974\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 28 MAY 2004\nConcepts: NARCOTICS, DRUG TRAFFIC, EXTRADITION, ARRESTS"

In making these assignments, it became obvious to me that at this formative stage in the development of the Bolivian narcotics control effort, we need all the qualified personnel strength we have at the moment to isolate and cope with the problems in this major area of concern. We will not be able to replace or retain one of our key team members for the next fiscal year unless we get a new position.\nI therefore request your assistance in assuring that an exclusively narcotics-related job is established in USAID/B as of the beginning of FY ’75. The embassy will produce a revised NCAP budget for FY ’75 incorporating this new cost should it be approved.\nI do not foresee the need for this new position beyond FY ’75. If the need should exist beyond that time, we could then study the matter again.\nFor the coming year, however, we do not want another enforcement officer. Instead, we need to increase our efforts of an advisory nature, our institution building role (including the establishment of a basic narcotics training facility in the Police Academy) and our research capabilities on the production, distribution and consumption of coca leaf during this first, formative year of Bolivia’s concerted approach to the narcotics problem. USAID has the kind of man I envision for this role which will give us the kind of clout with the Bolivians that I want to have at this stage in our incipient narcotics relationship.\nThis request is strongly supported by the USAID Mission Director and the embassy’s Narcotics Coordinator. The duties of the incumbent of this position will not impinge upon the work of DEA here. The two DEA agents presently on board are going to be fully occupied in the enforcement area, which for the next couple of years will include the responsibility of devising and implementing, in conjunction with the Bolivian Narcotics Director, U.S. Government commodity assistance and budgetary support for the operations of the Enforcement Department of Bolivia’s narcotics entity.

REMAINING LIQUID EXCHANGE RESERVES HAVE BEEN EXHAUSTED, THE BANKS ARE CLOSED, THE DOLLAR (PREVIOUSLY 20/1) IS NOW SELLING IN THE STREETS AT THE PANIC LEVEL OF 39 PESOS AND THERE IS CLEARLY NO WAY EXCHANGE TRANSACTIONS BY THE BANKING SYSTEM CAN BE RENEWED ON MONDAY WITHOUT A FLOAT OR DEVALUATION (MORE LIKELY A FLOAT SINCE THE CENTRAL BANK HAS NO RESERVES TO DEFEND A NEW RATE). AT LEAST THREE WEEKS OF MINING AND ENERGY PRODUCTION HAVE BEEN LOST, ASSURING THAT THE GOVERNMENT’S FINANCES AND THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS WILL BE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN THE RED FOR 1979. SHORT SUPPLIES OF FOOD AND FUEL, PLUS EXCHANGE RATE DEVELOPMENTS HAVE ALREADY CAUSED PRICES OF SOME\n\n162254Z\nBASIC CONSUMPTION ITEMS IN LA PAZ TO RISE ABOUT 20 PERCENT. PREVIOUS GOVERNMENTS HAVE MADE NO ARRANGEMENTS TO MEET BOLIVIA’S NEEDS FOR WHEAT BEYOND JANUARY 15, 1980.\n\nONE OF THE REASONS NATUSCH AND SOME OF HIS COTERIE YIELDED WAS THAT THE MILITARY COULD NOT FIND THEIR WAY OUT OF THIS FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC CRISIS. IT\n      Sheryl P. Walter \n\n   Sheryl P. Walter \n\nWILL BE IMPORTANT FOR THE FUTURE OF THE BOLIVIAN POLITICAL PROCESS THAT THE CIVILIAN GOVERNMENT CAN INDEED FIND ITS WAY OUT, WITH INTERNATIONAL HELP.\n\nTHE US SHOULD RESPOND PROMPTLY AND GENEROUSLY TO THE NEW GOVERNMENT’S PLIGHT. IN SIGNIFICANT PART WE CAN DO THIS BY REVIVING ALL OUR SUSPENDED ECONOMIC AID PROGRAMS, SOME WITH AN AMENDED FOCUS, AND OFFERING IMMEDIATE HELP ON WHEAT IMPORTS. IN PARTICULAR I SUGGEST THE FOLLOWING:\n\n–OFFERING AN IMMEDIATE $10 MILLION CCC CREDIT, AS THE FASTEST WAY TO TRY TO GET SOME WHEAT HERE BY MID-JANUARY. HOPEFULLY THE SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE CAN AGREE TO RE-PROGRAM THIS MODEST AMOUNT FOR BOLIVIA;\n–NEGOTIATING AN AMENDMENT TO THE PL-480 TITLE III AGREEMENT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE FOR $17 MILLION WORTH OF WHEAT, WHICH WOULD COME IN BEHIND THE CCC WHEAT AND MEET VIRTUALLY ALL OF BOLIVIA’S CONSUMPTION NEEDS FOR THE REST OF FY 80. THE COUNTERPART FROM OUR TITLE III WHEAT WILL ALSO HELP THE GOVERNMENT TO CONTINUE SOME PUBLIC INVESTMENT IN THE RURAL SECTOR;\n–WE SHOULD BE IMMEDIATELY AUTHORIZED TO CONCLUDE\n162254Z\nTHE AGRICULTRUAL CREDIT LOAN ($14 MILLION), IN THE NEXT WEEK OR SO.\n\nTHESE THREE MEASURES SHOULD, IF POSSIBLE, BE ANNOUNCED IN A SINGLE $41 MILLION PACKAGE, AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE MOMENT. WE SHOULD OBVIOUSLY NOT MAKE SUCH AN ANNOUNCEMENT UNTIL AN AGREEMENT IN PRINCIPLE HAS BEEN REACHED WITH THE IMF (NOT BOARD ACTION); HOWEVER, THIS POINT MAY COME VERY SOON, SINCE THE BASIC ACTIONS IN THE IMF’S LONG-STANDING PROPOSALS (EXCHANGE RATE CHANGE AND INCREASED PETROLEUM PRODUCTS PRICES) ARE LIKELY TO BE TAKEN WITHIN THE NEXT 72 HOURS. THE OTHER PARTS OF THE IMF PROGRAMARE NOT CONTROVERSIAL.\nWE SHOULD ALSO RENEW OUR EARLIER OFFER (TO PRESIDENT GUEVARA) TO TRY TO REFLECT ANY BOLIVIAN SUGGESTIONS IN OUR PROPOSED PROGRAM OF TIN SALES TO BE PRESENTED TO THE ITC FOR CONSULTATION. NEUTRALIZING ANY IMPACT OF GSA SALES ON THE TIN PRICE REMAINS VITAL TO BOLIVIA’S PRECARIOUS PROSPECTS FOR ECONOMIC STABILIZATION AND RECOVERY.\n   Sheryl P. Walter \n\n   Sheryl P. Walter \nTHE TIMING AND CONTENT OF DECISIONS ON MILITARY ASSISTANCE ARE MORE COMPLEX AND SHOULD BE DEFERRED FOR NOW. I RECOMMEND, HOWEVER, THAT WASHINGTON MOVE AS FAST AS POSSIBLE TO PUT US IN A POSITION TO MAKE SOME ANNOUNCEMENT ON THE ECONOMIC PACKAGE ABOVE.

He had promised Embassy coordinated response points (A) and (B) of para 2 ref A, but did say that flood damage reconstruction financing would be major topic for Bolivia at meeting and that specific IDB loan problems such as loans for YPFB refineries and Oruro-Quillacollo Highway probably would be dealt with in meetings with IDB missions already in Bolivia or soon to arrive.\nMINFIN subsequently asked Ormachea to call ECONOFF to discuss points (A) and (B). According to Ormachea, GOB del will wish discuss with U.S. del possible second loan for the Central Bank Agricultural Rediscount Fund (FRA), further PL-480 Title I Sales Agreement and flood reconstruction financing. GOB position on matters to be formally raised in plenary has not yet been established. Mercado and Ormachea agreed to meet with ECONOFF on March 25 to provide further info on points (A) and (B).\nRe point (C) para 2 ref (A), believe Treasury officials of U.S. del should explore with Mercado and Viscarra Bolivia’s balance of payments estimates (which are being carefully reviewed by annual Art. VIII IMF mission at present time) and with Ormachea YPFB’s prospects, plans and creditworthiness for possible Eximbank financing for major projects such as gas pipeline from Santa Rosa-Yapacani fields to Brazilian border at Corumba and Mutun iron/manganese deposit, fertilizer, pesticide and herbicide plants. YPFB also requires some US$ 30 million additional financing over US$ 46.5 million thus far offered by IDB for refineries program and has been negotiating with commercial banks to cover this requirement.\nRef B provides Mission’s current views on IDB program for Bolivia. We reiterate our concern that all agencies, bilateral and multilateral continue urge upon GOB desirability preparation agricultural production plan and coordination of its financing.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1974LAPAZ01754\nDate: March 21, 1974\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 JAN 1960\nConcepts: CENTRAL BANK, BIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION, DEVELOPMENT BANKS, COMMITTEE MEETINGS, ANNUAL REPORTS, FLOODS,"

Since the mood in the armed forces is somewhat better than we had anticipated, our reply can be less heavy than we earlier considered. The main point should be to indicate to the Bolivian military that democratic government will be a significant boost to Bolivia’s chances to realize its economic, political and diplomatic objectives. Padilla wants to see me Tuesday night, but I could probably put this off to Wednesday night. Hopefully by then I would be able personally to deliver the President’s reply to Padilla. End summary.\nMy suggested draft reply (in paragraphs 4 to 9 below) presumes decisions and actions on two matters: a successful approach to Senator Hart to get him to delay reporting out a stockpile disposal bill until after the Senate’s August recess; and a decision on our delegation to the inauguration, which I hope can be headed by Mrs. Carter, if at all possible. The proposed commitment not to sell tin in 1979 is not really a separate policy decision, since if the Congressional authorization is delayed to September, the normal consultation process will delay sales until 1980 in any event.\nBegin suggested draft letter. Dear Mr. President. I have taken to heart your thoughtful letter of July 6, in which you raise your concerns regarding U.S. tin policy and its relationship to Bolivia’s return to constitutional, elected government. I appreciate your raising these concerns with me in the cordial and open manner that is a hallmark of U.S. - Bolivian relations.\nFirst of all, Mr. President, let me congratulate you and Bolivian armed forces for your stalwart leadership in returning your country to democratic rule–a venture which has captured the imagination and admiration of my country and Bolivia’s friends everywhere. The successful completion of this hopeful process with the August 6 inauguration will place Bolivia firmly among the democratic countries of our Hemisphere and enhance Bolivia’s international standing and capacity to achieve its economic, political and diplomatic objectives.\nOn the matter of tin, let me assure you that the United States will manage any eventual disposals so as to safeguard against disruption of the tin market and the economic position of producers, including Bolivia. In response to your letter, the White House has contacted Senator Hart who, in recognition of Bolivia’s return to constitutional rule, has agreed to postpone Senate action on stockpile legislation until after the Senate’s August recess. This should assure that no dramatic news on tin occurs during the final stage of Bolivia’s efforts to complete the election process in your Congress. I can also assure you that no tin sales will take place in 1979, when Bolivia’s elected government is developing and implementing a program to stabilize the country’s economy. Any sales plans in 1980 will be developed on the basis of full consultation with Bolivia’s new, elected government, as well as with other producers, and will be designed to the best of our abilities to avoid depressing the export earnings Bolivia’s new government will need for its stabilization effort. You can also rest assured that my government will work through the international financial institutions and with Bolivia’s new government to help that government raise the financial support necessary to back a sound stabilization program.\nI am aware of your country’s plans to raise the issue of Bolivia’s aspiration for access to the sea at the OAS General Assembly meeting this October in La Paz. You know from my remarks to the OAS last year of my personal interest in this question. We will now be awaiting Bolivia’s definition of an approach to this issue with every desire to be supportive wherever we can.\nTo express as clearly as possible to the Bolivian people our goodwill and deep appreciation of the country’s orderly return to constitutional rule, I am asking my wife Rosalyn (alternate choice) to represent me at the inauguration of Bolivia’s new President on August 6.\nAs, Mr. President, approach the final stage of Bolivia’s return to constitutional rule, a process which you have so steadfastly overseen, let me wish Bolivia full success in this historic venture, and to you personally all the best in the future. End of suggested draft letter.\nThe President’s reply to Padilla would be most effective if I could have it in time to deliver personally by P.M. Wednesday July 11.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1979LAPAZ05838\nDate: July 08, 1979\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 20 Mar 2014\nConcepts: DEMOCRACY, POLICIES, TIN, DIPLOMATIC COMMUNICATIONS, ELECTIONS, STOCKPILE DISPOSAL, ACCESS TO PORTS"

According to the Foreign Minister, the letter requests comprehension of the USG of Bolivia’s hopes for an outlet to the sea. The letter will also express Banzer’s regret at not having been able to visit the US in fall 1973 and will note Banzer’s interest in making the visit at sometime in the future.\nSub-Secretary Foreign Ministry told me that the letter to President Nixon is not drafted as a request for any action on our part but rather is a review of what Bolivia considers to be an unjust situation and is designed to elicit from the US favorable understanding. The Sub-Secretary indicated that Bolivia may discuss its land-locked position with other Foreign Ministers but for the moment has put aside the idea of a circular memorandum to other Foreign Ministers.\nForeign Ministry has come under domestic political pressure to show some forward motion on behalf of Bolivia regarding an outlet to the sea. Leading La Paz newspaper Diario has criticized the Foreign Minister for ineptness in previous meetings and has joined others in calling on the Foreign Minister to express more clearly in meetings in Washington/Atlanta Bolivia’s deep-seated desires for an opening to the sea.\nIf the letter is indeed drafted as I have been told, it should not be difficult to answer. However, in the current emotional state here on return to sea, the reply should be written bearing in mind that it very likely will be published in the Bolivian press. With regard to a repeat invitation to President Banzer to visit the US, I would hope for a bland acknowledgment, again suggesting that it would be possible but at a mutually convenient time for both Presidents.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1974LAPAZ02306\nDate: April 15, 1974\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 28 MAY 2004\nConcepts: LANDLOCKED COUNTRIES, PRESS COMMENTS, DIPLOMATIC COMMUNICATIONS, ACCESS TO PORTS, FOREIGN POLICY"

Since this represents a substantial cut in anticipated level and will dismay GOB and cause problems for US with GOB military at a crucial time in Bolivian political situation, I would appreciate urgent reconsideration and upward ajustment in the Bolivia program for FY 74 to a level not less than the Continuing Resolution authority which has become common knowledge. I offer the following reasons in support of my request: A. The FY 74 allocation of $2.73 million is a reduction from the Continuing Resolution level of $3.5 million consisting of $2.9 million MAP-M and $.6 million MAP-T. To go below $3.5 million will mean heavy cuts of much needed equipment and training to operate equipment already delivered under the FY 72 and FY 73 programs for all services. B. Bolivian authorities have been pressing US hard in recent weeks for expeditious delivery of equipment in ongoing programs. They appear to be wondering whether we are holding back for some un-stated reasons. Were I to inform the Bolivian government at this time that the MAP grant program is now down to $2.73 million when they have knowledge that CR level is $3.5 million, their concerns would be increased and our rapport cum credibility reduced. C. A reduction in the Military Aid Program will be viewed as companion piece to “bad news” on PL480. We have had to tell the GOB that there will be no further PL-480 Title One program for FY 74 and that the chances are slim that there will be any for FY 75. The impact on President Banzer, personally, will be quite negative. D. Recently the Bolivian military authorities came to US with an urgent appeal for ammunition, and while we did approve the sale, we initially conditioned it on their coming to Panama to pick it up and our making a collection of payment in advance of its delivery. While this was ultimately worked out to our and the Bolivians satisfaction, nevertheless our conditions were not well received. E. I would observe that this 2.73 figure is drastically below the MAP figures in our approved CASP (4.7 million), in the Congressional Presentation Document (4.450 million) and in the Congressional Presentation Document as published (5.2 million). I have no basis on which to explain to the GOB why these higher figures are inoperative or what has caused this cut in the Bolivian MAP. While we may be misinformed, we have heard informally that the Congress has authorized funds sufficient to cover the approved Bolivian program. F. Bolivia is passing through a critical and fluid political/military period. President Banzer, although an army general, is now quite dependent on the Bolivian Armed Forces for his survival. Recent decisions on the economic front have brought the popularity of the Banzer regime to its lowest point since the October ’72 devaluation, with a consequent increase in divisive tendencies within the military. In a setting such as this, we can further our interests at little cost; or we can lose effective rapport by making the downward cut in our FY-74 MAP. The military program has been one of my principal influence and leverage mechanisms with the GOB. I have been able through the military program to apply pressure or to enlist support where political and economic means were not appropriate. To reduce the effectiveness of the tool will harm my ability to operate effectively.\nIn view of foregoing, I strongly recommend that ways be found to hold the FY-74 MAP program at the FY-73 level. Meantime, I shall not inform GOB nor will I have MILGP do so either.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1974LAPAZ00900\nDate: February 11, 1974\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 JAN 1960\nConcepts: MILITARY ASSISTANCE, MILITARY ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS"

This newly elected president will be beholden to us for our support of democratization in Bolivia. He will also have significant requests for further economic and political support from us. Therefore, it is the right time for us to raise our desiderata. Since late 1977 there has been a lack of strong commitment and drive from the top of the GOB, partly resulting from the electoral campaigns of 1978 and 1979. The US must seize the opportunity of the inauguration to impress upon the President-elect our major concern with illicit cocaine trafficking and production. The main point to impress upon him is that sterner, more disciplined GOB policies and enforcement action from the cabinet on down should be adopted. To help finance this increased Bolivian effort and to make it politically tolerable for the new president, the US will need to offer new financial support for narcotics programs in Bolivia. We should offer in return for Bolivian commitments $15 million (over five years) for measures to control the coca leaf market and, in addition to presently planned USAID projects for Bolivia in FY80, $19 million for an agricultural development program which will provide small farmers the incentives to cease or restrict their production of coca. Our ideas on the general content of a memorandum for the White House proposing such a demarche follow.\n\nA. Problem 1. Since November 1977, when then President Banzer announced that elections were to be held in July 1978, progress in achieving our goal of reducing the illicit flow of cocaine to the US has been disappointing. While substantial progress has been made in laying structural and institutional foundations for future efforts and drug seizures in 1979 have increased somewhat, the Bolivian Government has not shown the will to live up to its commitments. Primarily for political reasons related to election campaigns, the GOB has been weak and ineffective in the narcotics area, as indeed in others. 2. The GOB needs a sharp kick to awake it to its responsibility to: * Move against major traffickers; * Curtail or destroy new, illegal coca plantings; * Support vigorously an effective program of replacement income for farmers in coca areas; * Reduce corruption in the judicial system and keep traffickers in jail. 3. Bearing in mind the weakness of Bolivian political institutions and the US goal of encouraging free, democratic elections in Bolivia, we have not recently sought to force these issues. We should now, however, seek the new President’s commitment on these four points and, if we get it, offer our cooperation to implement a comprehensive strategy. 4. If the new government is found unwilling to cooperate with the USG in this respect, we should review again our narcotics strategy vis-a-vis Bolivia. A modest enforcement support program and a DEA presence in Bolivia will always be worthwhile for the US. However, without effective GOB action on enforcement, penal and judiciary reforms and destruction of new coca plantings, it is doubtful that major expansions of enforcement programs, large-scale agricultural development and coca income substitution plans or the establishment of a coca crop marketing monopoly would ever be successful in reducing production to the level demanded by the legal (chewing and leaf exports) market.\nB. Talking Points 1. For over three years the US has been engaged in an intensified cooperative campaign with the GOB to suppress the production and illicit traffic in cocaine. The US has contributed about $8.5 million to this effort since 1975 and has plans for greatly increased contributions and expanded efforts during the forthcoming years. 2. Nevertheless, the flow of cocaine continues unabated. As much as 48 metric tons of cocaine hydrochloride and base valued at about $170 million may continue to be exported from Bolivia. 3. The actual and potential danger which this represents to Bolivian youth continues and the corruptive and distorting effects on Bolivia’s young democracy of the flows of black money resulting from the traffic are on the increase.\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1979LAPAZ06238\nDate: July 21, 1979\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 jan 1960\nConcepts: NARCOTICS, DEMARCHE, PRESIDENT"

Since that time political instability has been an impediment to economic and social progress which in turn has resulted in an uneven record in terms of human rights observance. However, this trend began to change in 1977 when President Banzer initiated a liberalization of virtually all major restrictions on human rights, releasing all political prisoners, allowing exiles to return and scheduling elections for July 1978. The momentum of human rights progress has continued for the succeeding two years, with the sole dramatic exception of the violent 15-day rule of coup leader Alberto Natusch in November 1979.\nThe human rights momentum was not checked by the Pereda coup (August 1978) or the Padilla take-over (November 1978). Instead, while representing brief interruptions in the democratization process, both governments contributed to the improving human rights situation: Pereda by abrogating the feared State Security Law, and Padilla by holding in July 1979 perhaps the most democratic elections in Bolivia’s history.\nSince none of the eight presidential hopefuls achieved the needed majority of the popular vote in the July 1979 elections, the Congress selected Senate President Walter Guevara Arze to be interim president with new elections scheduled for May 1980.\nGuevara’s government came to an abrupt end November 1, 1979, when a group of military officers and civilians under the leadership of Army Colonel Alberto Natusch Busch seized the government. Strong popular reaction against the coup and its interruption of the democratic process, resulted in the implementation of press censorship, a state of siege, and martial law. Uncontrolled military elements confronted protesting but unarmed civilians, resulting in the confirmed death of approximately 208 persons, the wounding of 207 others, and the unaccountable disappearance of 124 citizens, now presumed dead. Popular discontent, an unprecedented seven-day strike by the Confederation of Bolivian Workers (COB), and Natusch’s repressive measures hastened the demise of his regime.\nConsequently on November 16 he was forced to resign and was replaced by Chamber of Deputies President Lidia Gueiler according to an agreement reached between the Congress, the COB, and the Armed Forces. President Guevara, who had become a resistance symbol in hiding during the Natusch regime, returned to his former Senate position. Ms. Gueiler is to be Bolivia’s interim president until the inauguration on August 6, 1980 of the winner in May elections.\nBolivia’s dire economic situation will undoubtedly complicate matters. Faced with dwindling foreign reserves and declining production of petroleum and tin, the new government will have to take strong economic measures to return Bolivia to economic solvency.\n\nSection 1 - Respect for the integrity of the person, including freedom from: A. Torture\n\nThe Bolivian Constitution clearly prohibits cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment. Presidents Padilla and Guevara respected this constitutional guarantee; there were no reports of torture during their brief governments. Allegations of torture during the short-lived Natusch regime remain unsubstantiated, but are currently under investigation by the Permanent Assembly on Human Rights (PAHR).\nThe assembly was also tasked by the Bolivian Congress on November 19 to document all cases of persons killed, wounded, or missing as a result of Natusch’s repressive tactics. When completed, these lists of names will be made public, although it is questionable whether such evidence will lead to any trials and convictions in the near future.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1979LAPAZ10216\nDate: November 28, 1979\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 jan 1960\nConcepts: HUMAN RIGHTS, REPORTS"

Bolivians are currently working on Kampala Landlocked States Conference, where Bolivia will be represented by Dr. Felipe Treidinnick Abasto, Minister-Counsellor of the Bolivian Embassy in Madrid, Spain. Dr. Treidinnick is a career diplomat and lawyer who has specialized in question of Bolivia’s right to an access to the sea.\nAccording to Dr. Del Villar, Bolivia is hopeful that Kampala conferees will agree to a unified position which will enable these nations to bargain as a bloc with other participants in forthcoming Caracas Conference. Bolivia already has carried out extensive consultations with Paraguay, and feels confident that the Paraguayans will go along with Bolivia’s initiatives at Kampala meeting. Bolivia’s major initiative at latter conference will be call for establishment of an international organization to control exploitation of sub-surface sea resources, and apportion proceeds from these resources among both coastal and landlocked states. Del Villar expressed great interest in learning details of U.S. Government’s position on this issue.\nRegarding the 200-mile limit question, Del Villar stated that Bolivia continues to oppose position adopted on this issue by four of its neighbors (Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Peru). Although he did not rule out possibility of bilateral bargaining on this issue between Bolivia and its neighbors, in return for concessions to Bolivia’s desire for a share in sub-surface sea resources, Del Villar said that Bolivian position on the territorial sea at present conforms much more closely to U.S. position on that issue.\nComment: This Embassy would appreciate receiving full information on any common positions adopted at Kampala Meeting of Landlocked States. At same time, Embassy also wishes to receive guidance on U.S. position re: exploitation of sub-surface sea resources, and Department’s views on degree of potential compatibility between our posture and that adopted by GOB, as expressed in paragraph 2 above.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1974LAPAZ01617\nDate: March 15, 1974\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 JAN 1960\nConcepts: LAW OF THE SEA, MEETING AGENDA, NEGOTIATIONS, MEETINGS"

Fuentes was not aware of the issue, but did note that Bolivia followed a line supportive of the Camp David Accords and one that eschewed introduction of divisive political issues in UN technical agencies. Hence his off-the-cuff reaction was that Bolivia would be helpful. Nevertheless, he requested an aide memoire to follow-up, since Bolivia will probably be represented at the conference by a technical functionary from the Agriculture Ministry, who would otherwise be unacquainted with some of the political issues.\nWe are preparing the memoire, and will provide name of Bolivian delegate when appointed, since follow-up in Rome might be useful. Fuentes also noted he had not been approached by Egyptian Embassy on the matter. A check with Egyptian Embassy reveals they have similar instructions, but had not planned their demarche before November 5.\nForegoing was prepared before attempted overthrow of Guevara regime, which is still in process. Hence follow-up will probably not be possible for an undetermined period.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1979LAPAZ09361\nDate: November 01, 1979\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 jan 1960\nConcepts: DEMARCHE, RELOCATION, AGRICULTURE, TRANSFER OF OFFICES, REPRISALS, SPECIALIZED AGENCIES (UN)"

ALTHOUGH PRECISE REASONS FOR CURRENT PROBLEM DIFFICULT TO UNTANGLE, BASIC CAUSE APPEARS TO BE FAILURE OF ARGENTINA TO FULFILL COMMITMENTS FOR FLOUR DELIVERIES. THIS HAS BEEN COUPLED IN RECENT WEEKS WITH GREATER THAN USUAL TRANSPORTATION DIFFICULTIES FROM PORTS, ESPECIALLY PERUVIAN RAIL STRIKE WHICH SLOWED MOVEMENT OF PL-480 WHEAT FROM MATARANI. SITUATION MAY IMPROVE THIS WEEK AS RAILROADS NOW MOVING WHEAT AT NORMAL PACE AND SMALL QUANTITY OF FOUR DUE TO ARRIVE FROM ARGENTINA, BUT SHORTAGES LIKELY TO REAPPEAR SINCE STOCKS WILL CONTINUE LOW AND SCARCITIES HAVE INDUCED SPECULATION AND CREATION BLACK MARKET. END SUMMARY.\n        \n            \n    \n    \n  \n\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE TELEGRAM\nUNCLASSIFIED\n\nAccording to Millers’ Association on January 10, mills had only 1,525 M.T. of wheat stocks. Two of three La Paz mills and one of two mills in Oruro were out and closed January 11. Mills reopened January 14 using wheat that arrived over weekend. Oruro and La Paz are supplied from Matarani. Mills in Cochabamba, supplied from Antofagasta, have improved position in first week of year but mills in other interior towns also showed decline in stocks. Authorities estimate that daily wheat consumption is 632 M.T. in country, of which 138 M.T. consumed in La Paz.\nUnder normal circumstances 2,000 M.T. of wheat can be moved from Matarani per week and 1,680 M.T. from Antofagasta. In fact, in December only 10,250 M.T. of PL-480 reached Bolivia from ports. On January 10, 6,000 M.T. of PL-480 wheat from October arrivals still in Antofagasta and 5,935 M.T. in Matarani from arrivals in November and before.\nAs reported earlier, GOB contracted last year for 86,000 M.T. flour from Argentina. When agreement failed to function it renegotiated in October for delivery 30,000 M.T. flour in following three months. At minimum Bolivia thus expected to receive 15,000 M.T. before end of year. Only 5,000 M.T. arrived. Sub-Secretary of MININD/COM traveled to Buenos Aires last week and government has announced that 1,500 M.T. Argentine flour due to arrive at border this week.\nScarcity of foodstuffs, including sugar, meat and cooking oil, has become principal Bolivian conversation topic. Week January 7, long waiting lines evident throughout city, especially in working barrios. Small demonstration of workers in Quillacollo near Cochabamba protesting shortages and prices broken up by police January 11. Nasty charges of hoarding and profitmaking have been aimed at millers and bakers. Government has made highly publicized “raids” on warehouses and La Paz authorities are now supervising distribution of certain products. Problem becoming political issue. Element of FSB called for end of wheat subsidy and another dissident FSB element published PL-480 arrival information and implied that quantities being misdirected. (Comment: We have no evidence of this. Problem seems to be shortfall arrivals).\nOn TV broadcast January 15, MININD/COM stated that contraband routes into Peru and Chile had been closely checked in recent weeks and that only very small amounts of flour had been found. Said this suggested that flour being hoarded and black marketed. After review steps being taken to speed deliveries Argentine flour to La Paz, said situation should ease in seven to ten days. (Comment: Situation not likely to improve much or for long unless flour and wheat stocks can be built up).\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1974LAPAZ00292\nDate: January 16, 1974\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 JAN 1960\nConcepts: FOOD SHORTAGE, AGREEMENTS, PUBLIC DEMONSTRATIONS, FLOUR, FOREIGN COMMITMENTS, BLACK MARKETS,"

IT IS NOT UNLIKELY THAT BOLIVIA ALSO WILL SEEK TO USE A REGIONAL LEGAL CONFERENCE ON LOS, ESPECIALLY ONE TAKING PLACE IN LA PAZ, TO SEEK TO OBTAIN A RESOLTUION SUPPORTING THE GOB’S CURRENT POLITICAL OBJECTIVES IN THIS REGARD; THE POSITION OF A U.S. DELEGATE TO THE CONFERENNCE COULD THEN BECOME ESPECIALLY DELICATE, DUE TO THE GOB’S DESIRE TO ELICIT EXPRESSIONS OF SUPPORT FROM ANY INDIVIDUAL WHO HAS OFFICIAL LINKS TO THE US GOVERNMENT.\n\nIN ADDITION, THE FOREIGN MINISTRY’S DIRECTOR-GENERAL OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, DR. MOISES FUENTES, HAS INDICATED TO US THAT THIS CONFERENCE IS BEING PRIVATELY SPONSORED AND ORGANIZED BY DR. FEDERICO NIELSEN REYES, A POLITICAL OPPORTUNIST WHO HAS MADE SOMETHING OF A REPUTATION FOR HIMSELF AS AN IDEOLOGUE OF BOLIVIA’S “RIGHT” TO AN ACCESS TO THE SEA. NIELSEN WAS RECENTLY NAMED A MEMBER OF THE GOB’S “MARITIME COMMISSION,” WHICH IS CHARGED WITH DEVELOPING NEW STRATEGIES FOR THE ATTAINMENT OF THE DESIRED OUTLET TO THE PACIFIC OCEAN. WE BELIEVE THAT IT WOULD BE OUT OF CHARACTER FOR AN INDIVIDUAL OF NIELSEN’S BACKGROUND NOT TO ATTEMPT TO USE THIS CONFERENCE FOR THE PURPOSE OF DRUMMING UP SUPPORT FOR THE CAUSE TO WHICH HE HAS DEVOTED A GREAT PROPORTION OF HIS ATTENTION IN RECENT YEARS.\nTHE EMBASSY WOULD APPRECIATE RECEIVING THE DEPARTMENT’S VIEWS REGARDING THE ADVISABILITY OF GRANTING COUNTRY CLEARANCE FOR THIS VISIT, IN VIEW OF THE CONSIDERATIONS NOTED IN PARAGRAPHS TWO AND THREE.

Moran, attorney for Applegate-Youngquist, in reply to his letter to GOB of January 11. GOB reply inter alia 1) states the GOB cannot be subject to pressures or threats; 2) renews offer of compensation in form of land; 3) asks for documentation regarding Applegate-Youngquist payment of taxes prior to seizure of land, deeds of title and appointment of legal representative for Applegate & Youngquist, or alternatively their presence in Bolivia, in order to deal with GOB on the matter. Although the letter is somewhat brusque in tone, we do not necessarily consider it a step backward since the documents sought by GOB are presumably available in one form or another from Applegate & Youngquist.\nGOB’s letter, of course, does not advance case beyond where it stood in December 1973 when GOB offered land in compensation but refused to pay any monetary compensation. Reftels, however, suggest that members House Agricultural Committee may have idea that GOB is totally intransigent on matter when in point of fact GOB offer of compensation in land represents considerable improvement in GOB position from what it was a few years ago. As regards Moran’s statement to Committee that he unaware of any “good faith efforts being made to settle case”, this at variance with his letter to GOB of January 11 in which he says “offer land compensation is first specific proposal for settlement received from GOB” and emphasizes “our appreciation” for offer. It should be noted also that Applegate & Youngquist would be free to sell land received in compensation if they do not choose to farm it. If land received in compensation can be sold at a price equivalent to the value of Applegate-Youngquist property at the time of taking, is this not in fact the same thing as monetary compensation? Finally, as far as Embassy aware, no Bolivian or foreigner has ever been compensated in any form for lands expropriated pursuant to Agrarian Reform legislation.\nIf House Committee seriously considering tightening discretionary provisions Sugar Act, Section 408 (C), with possible subsequent invocation against GOB, we believe Committee should have the full picture before acting. Testimony of lobbyist for GOB as reported State 046969, does not strike us as having given a complete picture of case. If Department unable to provide House Committee with current status report on case, we recommend that Bolivia’s lobbyist be advised promptly to do so.\nWe are pouching to ARA/BC copy of GOB letter of March 1.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1974LAPAZ01520\nDate: March 12, 1974\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 JAN 1960\nConcepts: LAW, LAND NATIONALIZATION, TAXES, ATTORNEYS, PROPERTY TITLES, FOREIGN POLICY POSITION, LAND REFORMS"

(See security case SY6-15237.)\nThe above action was taken based upon telcon, Ref B. Before the ratification the embassy sent a formal note to the Bolivian Foreign Ministry as recommended in Ref B. Text of said note follows: “79/028 The Embassy of the United States of America presents its compliments to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Bolivia and wishes to inform the Ministry that Gerald E. Snyder, First Secretary of the Embassy, has been authorized to waive his diplomatic immunity solely to the extent necessary in order to present an instructive declaration, in accord with Bolivian law, ratifying the complaint presented to the District Attorney on January 15, 1979 complaining of the acts committed by Rolf Silberstein, Kinjo Shimbaujuro and Shi Yu Cheng De Chang. This matter is now pending before the Fifth Court in La Paz. Other than permitting the execution of the above mentioned ratification, this waiver does not impair or restrict in any manner the diplomatic immunities enjoyed by Mr. Snyder under the provisions of the Vienna Convention and international law. The Embassy avails itself of this opportunity to renew to the Ministry the assurances of its highest consideration. La Paz, March 15, 1979 (Seal with Ambassador’s initials).”\nAn informal copy of the above note was given to the judge to be made part of the judicial record.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1979LAPAZ02492\nDate: March 22, 1979\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 jan 1960\nConcepts: DIPLOMATIC PRIVILEGES"

I TOLD THE PRESIDENT THAT OVER THE WEEKEND THE RECONSTRUCTION ASSESSMENT TEAM HAD DEPARTED AND THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE TEAM TO ASSESS ALTERNATE CROPS TO SUBSTITUTE FOR COCA HAD ARRIVED. I NOTED THAT AID WAS PREPARING AS EXPEDITIOUSLY AS POSSIBLE NEW LOANS IN THE AGRICULTURAL AREA, EDUCATION, AND FOR RURAL ELECTRIFICATION. I ALSO REPORTED THAT SEVERAL PIECES OF MILITARY EQUIPMENT HAD REACHED PERUVIAN PORTS IN RECENT DAYS AND THAT THE MILGP WAS IN THE PROCESS OF EXPEDITING ONWARD SHIPMENT TO LA PAZ.\nPRESIDENT BANZER SAID THAT THE MOST URGENT NEED FOR EXTERNAL ASSISTANCE FROM THE LENDING AGENCIES WAS FOR REHABILITATION OF THE NATION’S RAILROADS AND ROADS AND THE CONSTRUCTION OF DEFENSES AGAINST FUTURE FLOOD DAMAGE. HE SAID HE HOPED THAT THE REPORT OF THE RECONSTRUCTION ASSESSMENT TEAM WOULD BE FOLLOWED PROMPTLY BY FINANCING FROM WASHINGTON AGENCIES. HE URGED THAT CONSIDERA- TION BE GIVEN TO A LOAN THROUGH THE EXISTING PADES MECHANISM FOR\n\n141613Z\nA SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE RECONSTRUCTION WORK. HE SAID THAT THE PADES MECHANISM EXISTS, FUNCTIONS WELL, AND COULD EASILY ABSORB\nADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR PUBLIC WORKS PROJECTS BUT THAT GOVERNMENT REVENUES WERE NOT AVAILABLE FOR THIS PURPOSE\n\nPRESIDENT BANZER SAID THE NEXT MOST URGENT NEED IN EXTERNAL LENDINGWAS FOR COCA CROP SUBSTITUTION. FOLLOWING IN THE ORDER OF TIMING IN HIS JUDGMENT WERE THE LONG-TERM DEVELOPMENT LOANS OF AID. HE DEMONSTRATED FAMILIARITY WITH THE NEW LANDS LOAN AND SOME INFORMATION ON THE RURAL ELECTRIFICATION AND EDUCATION PROJECTS.\nTHE PRESIDENT EXPRESSED PLEASURE THAT MAP GRANT MILITARY EQUIPMENT WAS ARRIVING AND ASKED ME IF I WOULD HELP BOLIVIA OBTAIN C-130 TRANSPORT AIRCRAFT. HE SAID WHILE IT IS DESIRABLE TO HAVE TWO AIRCRAFT, NATURALLY THE COUNTRY WOULD BE SATISFIED TO START OFF WITH ONE. HE ADDED THAT WHILE IT WAS DESIRABLE TO HAVE NEW C-130’S, IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE UNITS ARRIVE PROMPTLY, SO THAT HE WOULD APPRECIATE OFFERS OF USED C-130’S IN GOOD CONDITION. HE SAID THAT IT WAS HIS HOPE THAT THE $4 MILLION FMS CREDIT WHICH HE HAS AUTHORIZED BOLIVIAN AUTHORITIES TO ACCEPT COULD BE CONSIDERED AS THE FIRST PAYMENT TOWARD ONE OR TWO USED C-130’S.\nPRESIDENT BANZER ASKED ME TO EXPRESS TO US AUTHORITIES HIS BELIEF THAT THE ECONOMIC SITUATION IS IMPROVING BUT THAT THE NEEDS IN A COUNTRY IN THE LOW STATE OF DEVELOPMENT AS BOLIVIA ARE ENORMOUS. THUS HE WELCOMES CONTINUED RESOURCES FOR DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES IN BOLIVIA. HE SAID THAT POLITICALLY THE COUNTRY WAS TRANQUIL AND THE SITUATION STABLE. HE SAID THAT HE ANTICIPATES MAKING NO CHANGES IN THE CABINET WHICH HAS PROVEN ITSELF TO BE COMPETENT AND TECHNICALLY WELL QUALIFIED. HE WILL BRING IN REPRESENTATIVES OF THE SMALLER POLITICAL PARTIES BUT NOT AT THE CABINET LEVEL, PROBABLY BRINGING THEM INTO SUB-CABINET POSITIONS IN MINISTRIES AND PUBLIC SECTOR AGENCIES.\nPRESIDENT BANZER WAS SUFFERING FROM A HEAVY COLD AND LOOKED TIRED AND RUNDOWN. HOWEVER, HIS MOOD WAS CONFIDENT AND, AS USUAL HE WAS VERY FRIENDLY.

CABINET MINISTERS, POLITICAL PARTY LEADERS AND THE JOINT COMMAND OF THE ARMED FORCES WERE PRESENT AT THE CEREMONY, WHICH MARKS THE FIRST\n\nSTAGE IN A PROCESS OF “CONSTITUIONALIZATION” SCHEDULED TO TERMINATE WITH THE INAUGURATION OF A NEW PRESIDENT IN DECEMBER 1975. IN IS SPEECH, BANZER NOTED THAT HIS GOVERNMENT SEEKS TO CREATE THE CONDITIONS WHICH WILL PERMIT THE ARMED FORCES TO RETURN TO THEIR BARRACKS, FOLLOWING TEN YEARS OF MILITARY RULE. AT THE SAME, TIME, HOWEVER, THE PRESIDENT\n012206Z\nNOTED T AT THE MILITARY WILL “OBSERVE AND GUARANTEE”\nTHE TRANSITION PROCESS TO CIVILIAN RULE, WHILE SUBSEQUENTLY RETAINING ITS ROLE AS THE “TRUE POWER FACTOR” IN BOLIVIAN SOCIETY.\n\nTHE THIRTY-MAN COUNCIL, -9 OF WHOSE MEMBERS TOOK OFFICE ON JULY 30, WILL NOW COMMENCE AN INTENSIVE PERIOD OF STUDY OF DIFFERING REFORM PROPOSALS. RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE COUNCIL MUST BE PRESENTED TO THE GOB BY JANUARY 23, 1975, WHEN CONARE’S MANDATE EXIIRES; THESE PROPOSALS WILL THEN BE STUDIED, AND POSSIBLY MODIFIED, BY THE GOVERNMENT, PRIOR TO THEIR PRESENTATION TO THE PUBLIC IN A NATIONWIDE REFERENDUM ON MARCH 23, 1975. ACCORDING TO THE INTERNAL RULES OF PROCEDURE ADOPTED BY CONARE IN ITS FIRST MEETING, ALL MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL WILL WORK FULL-TIME ON THEIR OFFICIAL DUTIES, FOR WHICH THEY WILL RECEIVE A SALARY FROM THE GOB. MOST OF CONARE’S WORK WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED IN COMMITTEES AND STUDY GROUPS; WHEN THE COUNCIL MEETS IN PLENARY SESSION, AN ATTEMPT WILL BE MADE TO ACHIEVE “CONSENSUS” ON EACH SUBJECT TO BE DEBATED, AND NO VOTES WILL BE TAKEN.\nCOMMENT: AS ORIGINALLY CONCEIVED BY THE BANZER GOVERNMENT, CONARE WAS TO BE COMPOSED OF FOUR REPRESENTATIVES FROM EACH OF THE GOVERNMENT PARTIES (MNR, FSB AND FUERZAS REVOLUCIONARIAS BARRIENTISTAS), CAMPESINOS AND THE ARMED FORCES, TOGETHER WITH 10 DISTINGUISHED PROFESSIONALS WHO WOULD PROVIDE THE COUNCIL WITH TECHNICAL EXPERTISE. HOWEVER, CONARE PRESIDENT EDWIN TAPIA, SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE PRESIDENCY AND LEADER OF THE FRB, HAS ENCOUNTERED SERIOUS DIFFICULTIES IN ASSEMBLING THE COUNCIL’S MEMBERSHIP. IN THE WAKE OF THE OUTRIGHT REFUSAL BY ALL OPPOSITION PARTIES TO PARTICIPATE IN THE COUNCIL’S DELIBERATIONS, PLUS THE DECISION OF THE ARMED FORCES NOT TO BE OFFICIALLY REPRESENTED ON THE COUNCIL, CONARE IS NOW COMPOSED OF THE FOLLOWING GROUPS OF CITIZENS: THREE DELEGATES EACH FROM THE MNR, FSB AND FRB; ONE REPRESENTATIVE FROM EACH OF THE NINE DEPARTMENTS OF BOLIVIA: SIX REPRESENTATIVES FROM NON-POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS (LABOR, BUSINESS AND CAMIESINO ORGANIZATIONS) AND SIX IROFESSIONALS.\nCONARE’S MEMBERSHIP REFLECTS THE GOB’S DIFFICULTY IN\n\n012206Z\nATTRACTING PROMINENT POLITICAL NAMES TO THE COUNCIL. NO OPPOSITION POLITICIANS ARE PRESENT ON THE COUNCIL, WHILE THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PRO-GOVERNMENT PARTIES ARE LESSER POLITICAL LIGHTS, FEW OF WHOM ARE WILL-KNOWN IN BOLIVIAN\nPOLITICAL CIRCLES. CAMIESINO AND LABOR DELEGATES TO THE COUNCIL ALSO APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN CHOSEN MORE FOR THEIR\nSUBSERVIENCE TO THE GOB’S WISHES THAN FOR ANY ABILITY TO SPEAK FOR THE CONSTITUENCIES WHICH THEY NOMINALLY REPRESENT. THE MOST NOTABLE COMMON CHARACTERISTIC OF THE COUNCIL’S TWENTY-NINE MEMBERS IS THEIR UNUSUALLY HIGH EDUCATIONAL LEVEL; 8 OF THE 29 ARE SUFFICIENTLY WELL-EDUCATED TO PREFACE THEIR NAMES WITH THE HONORARY TITLE OF DOCTOR. ALSO, SOME TEN OF THE COUNCIL’S MEMBERS HAVE RECEIVED LEGAL TRAINING.\n\nTHE COUNCIL WILL BE COMILETED WHEN A FURTHER LABOR REPRESENTATIVE IS CHOSEN; IF THE MINE WORKERS’ FEDERATION REJECTS THE POSITION OFFERED TO IT, THE LAST SEAT ON THE COUNCIL WILL GO TO A REPRESENTATIVE OF EITHER THE RAILWAY OR PETROLEUM WORKERS. A COMPLETE LIST OF THE COUNCIL WILL FOLLOW SHORTLY BY AIRGRAM.

I INDICATED THAT I DID NOT KNOW VERY MUCH ABOUT THIS MATTER BUT HAD HEARD THAT THE BOLIVIAN ARMY WAS INTERESTED IN TANKS SINCE THEY HAD BEEN IN TOUCH WITH US RECENTLY. PRESIDENT BANZER PICKED UP MY REMARKS AND SAID THAT COL. RIVERA HAD MADE A TRIP FOR OTHER PURPOSES TO EUROPE AND HAD MADE A VISIT TO THE SOVIET UNION WHERE HE HAD RECEIVED OFFERS OF SOME MILITARY EQUIPMENT. PRESIDENT NOTED THAT SOVIET AMBASSADOR TO BOLIVIA HAD BEEN ACTIVE IN RECENT MONTHS TRYING TO PRESS MILITARY EQUIPMENT ON BOLIVIA AND ALSO HAD BEEN ACTIVE IN OFFERING SOVIET FINANCIAL AND TECHNICAL COOPERATION FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE BALA DAM. PRESIDENT ALSO INFORMED ME THAT HE WAS PLANNING TO NAME A NEW AMBASSADOR TO THE SOVIET UNION AND PROBABLY WOULD SEND DR. RICHARDO ANAYA OF COCHABAMBA. IN THE LATTER CONNECTION, HE SAID THE SUBJECT HAD COME UP AS TO WHETHER OR NOT BOLIVIA SHOULD ACCEPT EXCHANGE OF PERSONS PROGRAMS, INCREASED CULTURAL PRESENTA- TIONS, AND HOW TO DEAL WITH MILITARY EQUIPMENT OFFERS. PRESIDENT BANZER SAID THAT THERE HAD BEEN NO FORMAL OFFER MADE TO THE GOB AND THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD NOT MADE ANY DECISION TO ACCEPT\n\n211825Z\nSOVIET EQUIPMENT. PRESIDENT SAID, ON HIS OWN VOLITION, THAT THE\nGREAT DIFFICULTY WITH SOVIET EQUIPMENT, EVEN IF IT IS A GIFT, IS THAT IT GENERALLY COMES ACCOMPANIED BY TECHNICIANS WITH OTHER INTERESTS. HE SAID HIS OWN EXPERIENCE WITH THE SOVIETS HERE IN BOLIVIA WAS THAT HE HAD TO KICK OUT SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE SOVIET MISSION FOR INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES. BUT, SAID PRESIDENT BANZER, THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE MORALE OF THE BOLIVIAN ARMY IS DEPENDENT UPON YOUNGER OFFICERS HAVING RELATIVELY NEW EQUIPMENT TO WORK WITH. GOB HAS NO INTENTION OF USING MILITARY EQUIPMENT, BUT THERE IS A NEED TO BOOST MORALE IN THE TROOPS. HE SAID THE BEST WAY TO COUNTER THE SOVIET PRESSURE FOR BOLIVIA TO ACCEPT THEIR MILITARY EQUIPMENT IS FOR THE PROMPT DELIVERY BY FRIENDLY COUNTRIES OF ITEMS APPROPRIATE FOR THE BOLIVIAN MILITARY.\n\nPRESIDENT BANZER SAID THAT HE KNEW QUITE A BIT ABOUT THE TANK SITUATION AS THAT WAS HIS BASIC MILITARY SPECIALTY, HAVING BEEN TRAINED IN THIS IN THE U.S. HE SAID HE KNEW THE M-48 BUT CONSIDERED IT TOO HEAVY FOR BOLIVIA. HE VOLUNTEERED THAT HE KNEW THAT THE M-41 WAS NO LONGER AVAILABLE. IN SUM, HE SAID THAT HE WAS WELL AWARE THAT THE U.S. NO LONGER PRODUCES A MEDIUM SIZE TANK APPROPRIATE FOR BOLIVIA. ACCORDINGLY HE SAID THAT IT WOULD BE AN APPROPRIATE ALTERNATIVE IF WE WERE TO PROVIDE FOR BOLIVIAN PURCHASE OF “CARROS DE ASALTO.” HE SAID THAT HE HAD PERSONALLY PURCHASED SOME EQUIPMENT FROM CADILLAC-GAGE AND FELT THAT LATE MODELS OF ASSAULT CARS WOULD SATISFY THE MORALE NEEDS OF THE BOLIVIAN ARMY. I ASKED HIM DIRECTLY WHETHER HE FELT TAHT US SALE OF ASSAULT VEHICLES OF THIS SORT WOULD ELIMINATE ANY INTEREST IN TANKS OFFERED BY OTHER COUNTRIES. HIS REPLY, WHILE SOMEWHAT ELLIPTICAL, WAS BASED ON THE FINANCIAL ASPECT OF OTHER COUNTRIES’ OFFERS. HE NOTED IT WOULD BE MOST DIFFICULT FOR BOLIVIA TO PASS UP WHAT MIGHT AMOUNT TO A GIFT. HE SAID THAT HE WOULD HAVE DIFFICULTIES WITH YOUNGER MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES WERE HE TO REFUSE TO ACCEPT EQUIPMENT FROM OTHER SUPPLIERS AT LITTLE OR NO COST, ALTHOUGH HE HIMSELF DID NOT WISH TO HAVE OTHER COUNTRIES’ TECHNICIANS PHYSICALLY PRESENT IN THIS COUNTRY. THE WAY HE LEFT THE SUBJECT WAS THAT PROMPT DELIVERIES OF PROGRAMMED AND SUITABLE MILITARY EQUIPMENT FROM OTHERS WOULD REDUCE SOVIET PRESSURES TO GIVE EQUIPMENT AND ANY JUNIOR MILITARY OFFICERS DESIRES TO HAVE SUCH EQUIPMENT.

THE PRESIDENT EXPRESSED HIS AWARENESS OF THE DANGERS OF INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES BY SOVIET TECHNICIANS AND INTIMATED HIS OPPOSITION TO RECEIPT OF SOVIET EQUIPMENT. YET HE IS ANXIOUS TO GET MORE UP-TO-DATE MILITARY EQUIPMENT FOR THE ARMY, PARTICULARLY, TO IMPROVE ITS MORALE. HE MENTIONED THAT DURING HIS RECENT VISITS TO MILITARY UNITS IN THE WAKE OF THE COUP ATTEMPT HE FOUND KULL SUPPORT FOR HIMSELF AND THE GOVERNMENT, BUT WAS QUESTIONED BY MANY YOUNGER OFFICERS ABOUT THE MILITARY EQUIPMENT THEY HAVE BEEN EXPECTING. I CONCLUDED DURING OUR TALK THAT WITHOUT SPECIFIC P&A DATA ON A TANK SUBSTITUTE SUCH AS AN ASSAULT CAR, THE PRESSURE ON US FOR EQUIPMENT WOULD INCREASE IF I APPLIED MORE PRESSURE ON HIM NOT TO ACCEPT MATERIEL FROM THE USSR. ALSO I BELIEVE THE ODDS ARE AGAINST THE GOB ACCEPTING SOVIET EQUIPMENT AND ESPECIALLY TECHNICANS.\nIF I CAN BE ARMED WITH P&A DATA ON A SUITABLE VEHICLE AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO A TANK TO GIVE PERSONALLY TO PRESIDENT BANZER, I COULD THEN, MORE SUCCESSFULLY I BELIEVE, MAKE A DEMARCHE, IF THE SECRET\n\nSECRET\n241732Z\nDEPARTMENT WISHES, TO HIM ABOUT SOVIET TANKS.

He asked me to make every effort to obtain such a reply if it had not been received. I told him that this very day we had received the definitive answer from Washington which unfortunately was negative. I told him, in accordance with State/AIDAC 5919, that no further PL-480 Title I wheat will be possible during FY 74. I told him that FY 75 availabilities and allocation not yet determined but situation is bleak. President Banzer was dismayed at the news which he characterized as “very bad.” He asked whether he should dispatch the Minister of Industry and Commerce to Washington on an emergency mission to try to seek reconsideration of Washington’s position. I told him that such a mission would be fruitless because there is no wheat for PL-480 allocation in the next five months. The President then inquired what Bolivia could do under these circumstances, given that Argentina has not met its commitments to deliver flour for the Bolivian market. I indicated that export credits may be available from private US banks and/or private exporters for the importation of wheat for Bolivian consumption. He immediately telephoned the Minister of Industry and Commerce to relay to him what he called the “bad news” and asked the Minister to undertake immediately to work out some alternative basis for acquisition of wheat.\nWe will now do what we can to interest US banks represented here and also to stimulate representatives of commodities concerns to make best possible offers to GOB. In this connection Washington help with major wheat suppliers would be welcomed. We intend have early meeting with Ministry of Industry and Commerce and will report results those talks.\nReftel states that CCC credit policy is to continue financing under existing lines of credit but not to authorize new lines. I would like to ask for special consideration for Bolivia under CCC so as to get the best possible terms for financing of Bolivia’s wheat import requirements. The volume of wheat required to meet demand for the balance of this calendar year is such that the ordinary commercial terms would place an extraordinary burden on the present foreign exchange earning capacity of this economy. Politically, it would be in the best interests of the US to move by stages, if that is necessary, away from PL-480 to straight commercial transaction by passing through a CCC credit arrangement at least for this year. I might note that in a recent meeting with US businessmen in La Paz, many of whom are long time residents here, I was told that the present wheat situation is the gravest that they have seen and outweighs, in their judgment, on political and economic terms, the expulsion of Dr. Victor Paz, head of the MNR, from the country. I am especially interested in having as forthcoming as possible a USG policy in face of the critical shortage of wheat at this time in Bolivia. A CCC credit for Bolivia would go a long way toward meeting those interests.

We are particularly pleased that the M-113A1 armored personnel carriers (14) and the 4.2 in. mortars (11) and the AN/VRC 18 radios (4) are scheduled for delivery not later than June 30 of this year. We are mindful of the difficulties inherent in the delivery schedules for AN/GRC and AN/PRC radios and for the 81 mm mortars, but hope that something can be done to accelerate delivery of at least a few of these items ahead of the dates as given in Reftel A. As indicated in Reftel B, even token deliveries of these items would assist us in dealing with recurrent GOB complaints that we are falling behind in our commitments under our Military Assistance Program to Bolivia.\nIn view of the reasons given for the inability to forecast deliveries for the 81 mm mortars and the radios, we do not feel it would be particularly useful for DOD to send an officer to Bolivia unless he would have authority to advance delivery dates ahead of the schedules given in Reftel A.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1974LAPAZ01291\nDate: March 01, 1974\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 JAN 1960\nConcepts: PROCUREMENT, MILITARY EQUIPMENT, MILITARY ASSISTANCE"

Therefore, it also assumes an Incremental Capital Output Ratio (ICOR) of at least three would be required to assure long-term growth at recent rates. Such an ICOR means investment would have to rise to about 16 percent of GDP. If additional investment is not well placed in productive sectors or efficiently managed, the ICOR is likely to be even higher. Note that we stated in paragraph 3D reference B that we believed investment would have to exceed 15 percent of GDP to assure continuation of current growth rates. We estimate that investment would have to reach about 19 percent to reach “self-sustaining” growth rates of 8 percent to 9 percent. This will be discussed with the IMF mission when it arrives.\nWe believe estimates of the subsidy paid in 1973, and what probably would have been paid in 1974, in comparison to the estimated wage increase cost in 1974, provide a better basis for seeing how the budget might worsen (paragraph 3 reference A). MinFin’s original budget (never released) did not allow for any 1974 wage increase. An IMF representative, on the basis of discussions with MinFin officials, estimates the total cost to the Treasury of wage increases granted thus far in 1974 at about $B 897 million, partly under the personal services line and partly under the current transfers to public sector line. On the other hand, we estimate the flour subsidy in 1973 was no more than $B 200 million. Without the increase in flour price in January from $B 177 per quintal to $B 300 per quintal, the subsidy in 1974 is likely to have been as much as $B 500 million.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1974LAPAZ01388\nDate: March 08, 1974\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 JAN 1960\nConcepts: ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, ECONOMIC GROWTH, GDP, GOVERNMENT BUDGET, WAGES, VISITS, ECONOMIC ESTIMATES,"

These scarcities were basically result of low domestic prices relative to external market and in the case of wheat flour absolute shortages caused by world-wide scarcities, failure of Argentina to supply flour under its agreements with Bolivia and possibly contraband movement of wheat flour to neighboring countries. Official price announced per pound for sugar is $B3.05 which 118 percent over previous official price of $B1.40 and 20 percent over effective market price of $B2.54 per pound. Common bread (pan de batalla) price was 30 centavos per unit of about 66 grams. Price increase to 50 centavos and reduction in weight to 53 grams results in increase of about 100 percent. New wheat flour price was increased approximately 52 percent over earlier official price and 10 percent over “black market” price. Price increased 145 percent over official price and about 20 percent market price.\nWage and salary increase of 400 perso per month represents 47 percent increase for lower income group, 27 percent for medium/low income group. On basis MINFIN salary survey, above groups represent approximately 84 percent of work force.\nComment: Price increases for the above products may be considered adequate in light of effective market prices. However, the maintenance of GOB presence in the pricing decisions implies that continued speculation could take place if prices inadequate relative to prices in neighboring countries. In case of flour world-wide availability, but especially availability from Argentina, will determine whether scarcity can be overcome at new price. It is unclear whether GOB will have to continue flour subsidy which depends on price in world market. For present GOB has not included subsidy in budget. Wage and salary increase for public sector which implies $B214 million in additional expenditures not fully included in budget. Concentration of increase in low income category means immediate translation into consumption expenditures adding further pressure on prices and imports. Appears that inflationary process will be difficult to slow in 1974–placing heavy burden on GOB incomes and monetary policies for remainder of year.

Also covered were the reported South African raid into Angola, Rhodesia sanctions and USG meetings with the Patriotic Front, and the Secretary’s meeting with the Black Caucus on October 31.\nBriefing commenced with following statement: “According to our information some military units around La Paz, Bolivia, have taken control of the central area of that city and declared their intention to install an Army Colonel, Alberto Natusch Busch, as President. The attitude of military units elsewhere in the country toward the attempted coup is not clear. Bolivia’s Constitutional President, Walter Guevara Arze, and the Commander of the Armed Forces, General David Padilla, have denounced this attempt to change the government by non-constitutional means. The United States is following these events with deep concern and would deplore any disruption in Bolivia’s democratic process.”\nQuestions centered on whether Secretary Vance delivered a message to Bolivian political figures warning against a coup during his recent trip there. Reston replied, “I want to put that in a positive framework. I think the Secretary emphasized our position in returning to democracy, which we have been seeing in the Andean Region. I think they are aware of our position.” Taken questions concerned Colonel Natusch’s background, U.S. relations with Bolivia, and diplomatic contacts with other governments in the region.\nIn response to a question on the anti-U.S. demonstration in Tehran, Reston replied: “There was a demonstration. Its purpose apparently was to protest the presence of the former Shah here in the United States. It seems to have been organized by religious groups associated with the regime in Iran. There were about 3,500 demonstrators. They were shouting slogans and placing banners on the walls of the American compound. The demonstration was peaceful and controlled, and at no time did any of the demonstrators enter the Embassy compound. The organizers of the demonstration have instructed their participants not to proceed to the Embassy and to end their demonstration at a place about three miles from the Embassy. That is what the main group did. We don’t have any accurate information about the size of the main group. I want to state, with regard to the protection that was afforded to our people and property in Tehran, that the Iranian government met fully its responsibility to provide security for the Embassy in Tehran by augmenting the police elements which normally protect the compound. We, the American government, appreciate the Iranian government’s additional steps for assuring the safety of the men and women who work in our Embassy.”\nRelated questions focused on whether Iran regime organized the demonstrations and if a group of 3,500 which approached the Embassy were acting according to plan. No response was offered which went beyond guidance in Paragraph 4 above.\nOn the reported South African raid into Angola, Reston replied, “We have been informed by representatives of the Angolan government and have seen press reports of the South African raid into Angola. We have no independent evidence to confirm these reports. If true, however, these reports only emphasize the urgency of obtaining an international settlement for Namibia. As we have stated before, we deplore any acts which contribute to the escalation of violence in the area. We note that Angola has requested a Security Council meeting for today on this matter. I would expect that the Western Contact Group will be making a further statement at that time.”\nOn Rhodesia sanctions, Reston went no further than to reiterate support for the British pre-independence proposals. A related question concerned a report that senior Patriotic Front officials were to meet with the Secretary. Reston replied, “Well, as you know, the Secretary is out of the country; he’s in Korea. And there is no such meeting scheduled. Let me say that, however–and let me go on background to say this–Mr. Josiah Chinamano of the ZAPU wing of the Patriotic Front and Mr. Edgar Tekere, who is Secretary-General of ZANU, were in Hot Springs, Virginia, last week to attend the Tenth African-American Conference, which is sponsored by the African-American Institute. The Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, Mr. Richard Moose, also attended that conference, had an opportunity for an exchange of views with those two particular leaders.”\nA question on the Secretary’s meeting with the Black Caucus concerned the subject of that meeting. A posted answer that afternoon read that the Middle East was the primary topic of discussion, although there was one question from a Caucus member which did not pertain to that area.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1979STATE286983\nDate: November 02, 1979\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 jan 1960\nConcepts: PUBLIC DEMONSTRATIONS, GOVERNMENT OVERTHROW, TOSEC, PRESS SUMMARIES, POLITICAL SITUATION, STUDENTS,"

CONSUMPTION WAS CURTAILED IN FY 1974 BY (A) FAILURE OF ARGENTINA TO DELIVER ON COMMITMENTS AND OF GOB TO MAKE TIMELY ALTERNATIVE ARRANGEMENTS;\n\n\nTRASNPORTATION DIFFICULTIES THAT AFFECTED ARGENTINA, BOLIVIAN, CHILEAN AND PERUVIAN RAILWAYS (MAINLY BECAUSE OF INSUFFICIENT RAILWAY CARS, STRIKES, LANDSLIDES AND FLOODING) AND THAT AFFECTED INTERNAL DISTRIBUTION IN BOLIVIA WHETHER BY RAIL OR TRUCK (MAINLY DUE TO LANDSLIDES AND FLOODING); AND (C) RISING PRICES OF WHEAT, FLOUR AND BREAD. OUR PROJECTION FOR FY 1975 ASSUMES CONSUMPTION WILL RETURN TO AT LEAST FOUR PERCENT ANNUAL GROWTH TRACK TAKING FY 1973 AS BASE YEAR. (HISTORICAL CONSUMPTION TREND FROM 1968 TO 1972 WAS SLIGHTLY MORE THAN 5 PERCENT). SHOULD CONSUMPTION NOT REACH THIS LEVEL AND INSTEAD REMAIN STAGNANT AT ABOUT 245,000 M.T., OUR PROJECTION WOULD IMPLY HEALTHY AND MUCH NEEDED INCREASE IN STOCKS TO ABOUT 27,578 M.T. STOCK LEVEL IN TABLE 2 UNREALISTI- CALLY LOW AND GOB AUTHORITIES UNDOUBTEDLY PLANNING TON HIGHER LEVEL.\n\n\nOUR COMMERCIAL IMPORT ESTIMATES FOR FY 1975 INCLUDE 20,000 M.T. OF FLOUR ALREADY PURCHASED FROM U.S., 30,000 M.T. OF WHEAT WHICH PROBABLY WILL ALL COME FROM U.S. UNDER ALREADY AUTHORIZED CALL FOR BIDS AND 90,000 M.T. OF FLOUR FROM ARGENTINA UNDER AN AGREEMENT\n\n01 OF 02 142301Z\nALREADY REACHED WITH GOA. 6. GOB AUTHORITIES HAVE LITTLE CONFIDENCE, HOWEVER, THAT 90,000 M.T. FLOUR AGREEMENT WILL BE CARRIED OUT. GOA FAILED TO DELIVER ABOUT 34,000 M.T. OF FLOUR AT US$ 165 PER M.T. UNDER 1973 AGREE- MENT. ACCORDING TO SUBSECRETARY LANDIVAR GOB HAD OPENED L/C’S AND MADE DOWN PAYMENT IN 1973 ON REMAINING 34,000 M.T. AND IS NOW REFUSING PROCEED WITH PURCHASES UNDER 90,000 M.T. AGREEMENT UNTIL 1973 COMMITMENT FULFILLED OR DOWN PAYMENT RETURNED. GOB\nALSO HAD AGREEMENT WITH GOA TO PURCHASE 30,000 M.T. OF WHEAT IN ADDITION TO 90,000 M.T. OF FLOUR, BUT THIS AGREEMENT WAS CAN- CELLED (PRESUMABLY BEFORE L/C’S OPENED) WHEN GOB DISCOVERED THAT WORLD MARKET WHEAT PRICES, ESPECIALLY U.S. PRICES, HAD FALLEN FAR BELOW GOA QUOTE. UNCERTAINTIES ABOUT ARGENTINE DELIVERIES MAY GROW INTO MAJOR PROBLEM, CAUSING GOB TO SHIFT SOME OF THESE FLOUR PURCHASES TO OTHER SUPPLIERS IN LATE CY 1974. 7. BOLIVIA HAS GREATLY IMPROVED EXPORT EARNINGS PROSPECTS AND B/P SURPLUS FOG CY 1974. BELIEVE, HOWEVER, ATTENTION SHOULD BE GIVEN TO FORTUITOUS AND LIKELY HIGHLY TRANSIENT NATURE THIS IMPROVEMENT. FIRST, IT SHOULD BE BORNE IN MIND THAT IN CY 1973, BOLIVIA’S FOREIGN EXCHANGE COST FOR 93,800 M.T. OF IMPORTED FLOUR WAS ABOUT US\\(16.9 MILLION AND FOR ABOUT 71,400 M.T. OF IMPORTED WHEAT (ALL\nPL-480 TITLE I) WAS ABOUT US\\) 4.2 MILLION INCLUDING CUP, 5 PERCENT DOWN PAYMENT, INTEREST, FREIGHT AND INSURANCE. AT CURRENT PRICES OF ABOUT US$ 290 PER M.T. (CIF LA PAZ) FOR IMPORTED FLOUR AND US$ 200 PER M.T. (CIF LA PAZ) FOR IMPORTED WHEAT, SAME TONNAGES WOULD COST US$ 27.2 MILLION AND US$ 14.3 MILLION RES- PECTIVELY WITHOUT PL-480 CREDIT. THIS WOULD MEAN SUDDEN US$ 20.4 MILLION IMPORT COST. ON BASIS OUR CURRENT ESTIMATES FOR FLOUR AND WHEAT US$ 15.2 MILLION (USING ABOVE UNIT COSTS) FOR US$ 28.5 MILLION INCREASE OVER 1973 PAYMENTS. THIS INCREASE PLUS ALMOST US$ 20 MILLION INCREASE IN GULF COMPENSATION PAYMENTS OVER 1973 AND OTHER DEBT SERVICE INCREASES WILL CUT DEEPLY INTO BOLIVIA’S EXCHANGE RECEIPT GAINS DESPITE RISING PRICES FOR METALS AND HIGH, BUT DECLINING, PRICES FOR CRUDE OIL. 8. WHILE BOLIVIA’S 1974 BALANCE OF PAYMENTS SURPLUS NOW MAY TURN OUT TO BE CLOSER TO US$ 50 MILLION THAN TO LOW END OF RANGE SENT REFAIR, THIS DUE IN LARGE PART TO LARGE COMMERCIAL BANK LOANS WHICH DO NOT INDICATE STRENGTHENING OF BASIC BALANCE. WHILE BASIC BALANCE PROBABLY WILL IMPROVE IN 1974, MUCH BASED ON FRAGILE PRICE INCREASES OF METALS (CONCENTRATES) EXPORTS. NO ONE SURE WHEN SPECULATIVE BUYING MAY END AND SEND PRICES DOWN.\n01 OF 02 142301Z\n\nB/P SURPLUS FOR BOLIVIA LIKELY TO BE SHORT-LIVED AS IMPORT PRICES, FREIGHT AND INSURANCE COSTS CATCH UP WITH EXPORT PRICE INCREASES. IMF HAS PROJECTED B/P SURPLUS MAY ALMOST DISAPPEAR AND MAY WELL BE IN DEFICIT IN 1975 AND THAT CURRENT ACCOUNT BALANCE WILL AGAIN BE DECIDEDLY NEGATIVE ON ALL REASONABLE ASSUMPTIONS. ADDITIONAL B/P ANALYSIS BEING SENT SEPTEL UNDER PREPARATION WITH SUBJECT TITLE “IMPLICATIONS FOR BOLIVIAN ECONOMIC AND DEVEL- OPMENT PROSPECTS OF ITS 1974 EXPORT PRICES”.

The Foreign Minister indicated that the staff of the Foreign Ministry is working on some positions but basically Bolivia has no particular points; rather wishes to participate with the other Foreign Ministers in the preparatory session in Mexico to work out a constructive agenda. He expressed interest in special tariff preference legislation and hoped that the Congressman would assist in bringing about a final and helpful bill inasmuch as Bolivia considers opportunities in relations with the U.S. as more potentially beneficial than benefits to be derived from Latin American integration which is going so slowly. Foreign Minister indicated his appreciation for U.S. assistance and hoped for a continuation of such cooperation, without which, he said, Bolivia cannot break out of its low level of development. He repeated the GOB’s interest in PL-480 wheat imports from the U.S. because of the acute shortage of flour and wheat which could create political problems. Mr. Whalen said that there was a high demand for wheat and a consequent short supply in the world. He did say though that he understood that Bolivian and U.S. authorities were discussing the Bolivian request, and he knew that the USG would do whatever it could, although the situation with regard to wheat is bleak.\nCongressman Whalen inquired about Bolivia’s attitude toward the OAS and Cuba. Foreign Minister expressed support for an effective OAS and felt that efforts should go forward to reconstruct it for the benefit of all members. Foreign Minister said that Bolivian Ambassador Valencia, who occupies double capacity of Ambassador to the U.S. and to the OAS, would join him in Mexico as his advisor on key discussions of OAS aspects during the Foreign Ministers’ meeting. As to Cuba, he said the position of the GOB is constant and firm in viewing Cuba as a menace which has harmed Bolivia seriously. Foreign Minister said that Bolivia does not wish to have any variation in the present OAS policy toward Cuba.\nCongressman Whalen asked if the Foreign Minister would give him any official explanation for the expulsion of Dr. Victor Paz on January 8. The Minister said that the departure of Dr. Paz was a surprise to him and that the instructions to deport him were directed by President Banzer himself.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1974LAPAZ00179\nDate: January 10, 1974\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 JAN 1960\nConcepts: WHEAT, CODELS, MEETINGS, MEETING REPORTS, FOREIGN POLICY POSITION, FOREIGN MINISTERS MEETINGS, FOREIGN"

ACTION REQUESTED: ADVISE STATUS OF GOB REQUEST FOR NEW PL-480 AGREEMENT (SEE LA PAZ 5021 OF AUGUST 16, 1973, AND SUBSEQUENT.)\n        \n            \n    \n    \n  \n\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE TELEGRAM\nUNCLASSIFIED\n\nMinister blamed Bolivian difficulties on failure of Argentine government to fulfill October 1973 agreement for 30,000 metric tons of wheat flour. According to Pereda, despite repeated assurances from Argentine embassy, only 5,000 tons have arrived to date and Bolivians have concluded that they cannot count on Argentina to meet vital need for flour imports. While recognizing that Argentina too had wheat problem, Minister opined that slowness of shipments due to “politics” connected with bilateral gas and petroleum negotiations.\nMinister’s anxieties seemed to be prompted by report Presidential Economic Advisor Willy Vargas brought back from his Washington visit alleging that U.S. officials not RPT not contemplating further wheat shipments in first semester 1974. MININD/COM officials made confused deduction from this that U.S. wished to place PL-480 agreement on U.S. fiscal year basis. As reported REFTEL and confirmed by Minister, PL-480 shipments now underway are believed sufficient with national wheat to meet needs until end of March. Minister thus feared that country would be without wheat from then until July.\nAmbassador expressed understanding of Minister’s anxieties but recorded that embassy has not yet received instructions for negotiation of new agreement. ADCM Whiting explained that if new agreement worked out in time, shipments theoretically could be made in March to July period but stressed uncertainties re wheat availabilities. In view possibility Argentina might not supply, he mentioned need for GOB to study commercial purchases from countries other than Argentina. Minister asked embassy convey his request urgently to Washington authorities and said he would send instructions to GOB Embassy Washington ASAP.\nComment: Minister’s concern is without doubt genuine. Price and scarcity of flour has been one of GOB’s most constant and truculent political problems as evidenced by long lines of unhappy housewives waiting to purchase bread or flour that have reappeared periodically in recent months. Bolivia has relied on Argentine shipments not only because southern neighbor historical supplier to Bolivia but also because last year’s bilateral agreement gave favorable price (US$ 165/metric ton). Now with problem of Argentine deliveries added to worldwide shortage, GOB seems to be aware of serious need to stimulate national wheat production. It will take time, however, to improve past performance and GOB is relying on U.S. to help avoid politically sensitive shortage after March. GOB has urgent need to know what supplies it can count on. Therefore, we should respond on new agreement ASAP, and we recommend as affirmatively as possible in view political and economic justifications and apparent inability and unwillingness of usual supplier–Argentina–to ship flour.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1974LAPAZ00015\nDate: January 02, 1974\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 JAN 1960\nConcepts: FOOD SHORTAGE, WHEAT, AGRICULTURAL AGREEMENTS, PL 480 TITLE 1, NEGOTIATIONS"

Paul and Bartolucci of AID who are in Bolivia to consider possible location here of an AID-financed regional center for remote sensing. President Padilla presented the Ambassador with the text of a letter to President Carter (repeated beginning paragraph 5 below with informal English translation). The original letter is being forwarded through the Bolivian Embassy in Washington.\nPresident Padilla said he wanted to emphasize his deep personal interest in locating the Latin American Regional Remote Sensing Center in Bolivia. He noted that this was an area of advanced technology where Bolivia’s capability was well established and known to the U.S. through previous U.S.-Bolivian collaboration. President Padilla wanted to assure us that the Bolivian Government would do all that was necessary to support such a regional center if the U.S. could agree to locate it in Bolivia. He wanted to provide blanket assurance that the facilities and full cooperation of such a regional center would be available to all other Latin American countries without reservation, including Chile. The President also underlined that under several governments in Bolivia there has been continuity in the managers and technical personnel of Bolivia’s remote sensing programs and that this continuity would pertain in the future as well.\nThe Ambassador noted that we were indeed deeply impressed with Bolivian capabilities in the area of remote sensing technology and its productive application. He said that we do indeed consider Bolivia to be a solid candidate, among several others, for location of the regional center. The Ambassador said that he would do what he could to encourage location of the center in Bolivia.\nMr. Paul explained the background of the proposal for a Latin America Regional Center and the experience AID has had with such centers in Africa and Asia. He noted that funds to support such a center could be available not only from AID but from the United Nations, the Andean Pact and other institutions as well.\nThere follows Spanish text of letter to President Carter from President Padilla as presented to the Ambassador:\n\n\nLA PAZ, 23 DE FEBRERO DE 1979 EXCELENTISIMO SENOR PRESIDENTE: TENGO A HONRA DIRIGIRME A VUESTRA EXCELENCIA, PARA PONER EN SU DIGNO CONOCIMIENTO QUE MI PAIS, COMO UN POSITIVO EFECTO DE LA EXCELENTE UTILIZACION DE LA TECNICA DE SENSORES REMOTOS LOCALIZADOS EN PLATAFORMAS ESPECIALES DE LA SERIE LANDSAT DE LA ADMINISTRACION NACIONAL DE AERONAUTICA Y DEL ESPACIO (NASA) DE LOS ESTADOS UNIDOS, HA PODIDO OBTENER SIGNIFICATIVAS APLICACIONES Y RESULTADOS EN EL ESTUDIO DE LOS RECURSOS NATURALES DE BOLIVIA.

I POINTED OUT TO MINISTER LEMA THAT USG DOES NOT TAKE ANY POSITION ON THE MERITS OF THE CASE. I NOTED THAT USG DOES NOT WISH TO BECOME DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN PROCEEDINGS BETWEEN THE PARTIES. I TOLD THE MINISTER THAT TYE HAD PRESENTED HIS ARGUMENTS TO THE DEPARTMENT WHICH HAD MADE A REVIEW OF THE CASE TO DETERMINE HOW WE COULD HELP RESOLVE THE PROBLEM. I STRESSED THAT THE DEPARTMENT BELIEVES THAT THE APPROACH WE ARE SUGGESTING SEEMS TO US TO OFFER BEST PROSPECT FOR SOLUTION.\nMINISTER LEMA RESPONDED THAT BOLIVIAN AUTHORITIES, PRIOR TO EMBOSA LIQUIDATION, HAD CONSIDERED ARBITRATION PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 41 OF THE STATUTES BUT IDEA WAS DISCARDED AS NOT FEASIBLE WAY OF SETTLING DISAGREEMENT WITH TYE. COMPANY WAS THEN LIQUIDATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATUTES. GOB BELIEVES LIQUIDATION AND ALL\n\n072056Z\nMATTERS PERTAINING THERETO WERE CORRECTLY HANDLED, LEGALLY AND\nTECHNICALLY. FURTHERMORE, GOB BELIEVES FRANK TYE ADEQUATELY COMPENSATED BY PRESENT BOLIVIAN REGIME BY CASH PAYMENT US$1.4 MILLION FOR IMPC EXPROPRIATION. IN VIEW OF FOREGOING, MINISTER SAID IT WOULD NOT BE POLITICALLY ACCEPTABLE NOR LEGALLY APPROPRIATE FOR GOB TO ORGANIZE NOW AN ARBITRATION OR OTHER PROCEEDINGS FOR MATTER WHICH IT FEELS HAS BEEN FAIRLY AND CORRECTLY HANDLED. MINISTER THEN SAID GOB IS ABOUT TO PRESENT “DENUNCIA” AGAINST TYE FOR US$400,000 WHICH GOB ASSERTS TYE OWES COMIBOL FOR OPERATING COSTS IN THE PERIOD OF MARCH TO NOVEMBER 1973. MINISTER LEMA ALSO SAID THAT HE HAD HEARD THROUGH FRIENDS THAT FRANK TYE HAD SAID HE WOULD TAKE CERTAIN LEGAL ACTIONS IN US AGAINST BOLIVIA. MINISTER OBSERVED THAT FOR GOB TO ENTER INTO SOME FORM OF ARBITRATION AFTER REPORTED THREATS OF ACTION AGAINST GOB WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO EXPLAIN SATISFACTORILY IN BOLIVIA. HE ALSO SAID THAT HE ALSO BELIEVES THAT IT WOULD NOT BE IN US INTEREST FOR THE GOB TO ARRANGE FOR ARBITRATION BECAUSE MOST BOLIVIANS WOULD ASSUME THAT PROCEED- INGS OPENED UNDER PRESSURE BY USG AND WOULD REACT NEGATIVELY. THE MINISTER CONCLUDED BY STATING THAT SINCE IT GENERALLY BELIEVED THAT TYE ONLY WISHES TO EXTRACT MORE MONEY FROM BOLIVIA AND SINCE GOVERNMENT ABOUT TO PRESENT CLAIM AGAINST HIM, ARBITRATION NOT ACCEPTABLE TO GOB.\n\nI CHOSE TO RAISE MATTER WITH MINISTER OF MINES BECAUSE HE IS THE RESPONSIBLE OFFICIAL IN THE MINING SECTOR AND TO HAVE GONE AROUND HIM ON SUCH A SENSITIVE MATTER WOULD HAVE BEEN DETRIMENTAL TO OUR OTHER INTERESTS IN THE MINING FIELD. FURTHERMORE, RECENT RUMORS ARE THAT LEMA MIGHT BECOME MINISTER OF ENERGY AND HYDRO- CARBONS, A SECTOR OF INCREASING IMPORTANCE TO US. ALSO I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT LEMA HOLDS DIFFERENT VIEWS ABOUT TYE AND IMPC THAN, ACCORDING TO REPORTS, ARE HELD BY PRESIDENT BANZER, EX- MANAGER OF COMIBOL GENERAL MIRANDA, EX-PRESIDENT EMBOSA BOARD MANUEL MERCADO (NOW PRESIDENT OF CENTRAL BANK), MINISTER FINANCE QUIROGA, AND EX-MINISTER SECRETARY GENERAL OF PRESIDENCY GUIDO VALLE.\nIN PRELIMINARY PLEASANTRIES WITH THE MINISTER, I MENTIONED THAT I PLANNED TRIP TO US SOON AND HOPED TO HAVE CONSULTATIONS IN DEPARTMENT OF STATE. AS I WAS DEPARTING FROM HIS OFFICE, MINISTER LEMA SUGGESTED THAT I TAKE ADVANTAGE OF CONSULTATIONS TO EXPLAIN TO SENIOR US OFFICIALS THE REALITIES OF THE PRESENT\n\n072056Z\nBOLIVIAN SITUATION WHICH MAKE ARBITRATION OF THIS MATTER UN- ACCEPTABLE. HE NOTED THAT BANZER REGIME RECORD OF AMIACABLE RESOLUTION OF INVESTMENT DISPUTES SHOULD BE BORNE IN MIND.\n\nI DID NOT REQUEST, NOR DID THE MINISTER OFFER, ANY INFORMATION ABOUT QUID PRO QUOS IN FORM OF TAX CREDIT RELATING GIBRALTAR HUARI-HUARI VENTURE WITH IMPC/EMBOSA CLAIM. I WOULD LIKETO NOTE THOUGH THAT IN PARAGRAPH 4, THE FYI SECTION, OF REFTEL, IT IS\n\nSTATED THAT “TYE INDICATED HE MIGHT BE WILLING TO DROP IMPC/EMBOSA CLAIM IF GOB WOULD NOT EXERCISE ITS STOCK OPTION ON GIBRALTAR HUARI-HUARI MINING VENTURE WHICH EXPIRED MARCH 1.” WE HAVE COPY OF TYE’S LETTER DATED JANUARY 21, 1974, ADDRESSED TO MARSHALL WRIGHT, THEN ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE OF CONGRESSIONAL RELATIONS, IN WHICH TYE WROTE “WE WOULD BE WILLING TO ACQUIESCE IN SUCH (COMIBOL) OWNERSHIP AND RELINQUISH OUR CLAIM WITH RESPECT THERETO IF THE BOLIVIAN GOVERNMENT WILL RELINQUISH ITS OPTION, GRANTED TO IT IN THE NATIONALIZATION SETTLEMENT, TO ACQUIRE 51 PERCENT OF GIBRALTAR HUARI-HUARI MINE CORPORATION.” SINCE GOB HAS DROPPED ITS OPTION, I HAD THOUGHT TYE WOULD, ACCORDING TO HIS OWN LETTER, DROP EMBOSA CLAIM.\n\nI HOPE THAT THERE WILL BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THIS MATTER FURTHER IN WASHINGTON DURING MY CONSULTATION. STEDMAN\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1974LAPAZ02914\nDate: May 07, 1974\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 JAN 1960\nConcepts: n/a"

In order that we can expedite the procedures to transfer these units to your Navy, I would suggest the submission of a diplomatic note to the U.S. government stating your country’s wish to make this purchase. The means of funding the craft is, of course, at your discretion. The use of MAP funds might be a possibility and this avenue would require coordination with our Military Group in Bolivia. Another means is by a direct purchase through the Foreign Military Sales. After the diplomatic note has been submitted and approved, precise price and availability information of the patrol craft can be provided. This will, in turn, provide the basis for an official letter of offer and acceptance. I would estimate that the craft would be ready for shipment to Bolivia within sixty days after the financial arrangements have been completed.”\nUpon receipt of information that this letter had been sent to the Bolivian Navy, I have had a special meeting with the appropriate members of the MILGP and the Defense Attache’s office to evaluate the offer and to formulate our responses if we receive a note as Admiral Zumwalt has suggested to the Bolivian Navy. As a result of this meeting, I have concluded that there is no objection on substantive grounds to the acquisition of these vessels from US, but I wish to record in the following paragraphs some observations about the manner in which this offer was made.\nAlthough Admiral Zumwalt’s letter invites the GOB to consider inclusion of the patrol craft under MAP, this is a matter which of course should be reviewed by the IG/ARA and by the PMG if this mission were to recommend it, which we do not. Our position is that the Bolivians should either pay cash or use FMS. Accordingly, we are informally undertaking to discourage the Bolivian Navy from asking us to provide these vessels under MAP. We believe that this actually coincides with the Bolivian Navy’s wishes to be on a more independent basis. If this analysis is correct, then the MAP suggestion in the letter may not cause us any political problems.\nThe concerns I have about the manner in which the offer of the patrol craft was made are both substantive and procedural. The U.S. is conducting a MAP program in Bolivia and has sought over the past several years to develop a concept of coordinated or joint planning for this program. Thus, requests from Bolivian authorities for military equipment should be channeled through the MILGP here and then reviewed in an appropriate inter-agency forum in a systematic way in Washington. If Washington approval is then given to an offer of equipment, such an offer should be made by me or by elements of my mission at my direction so as to reinforce the Embassy’s role as the responsible agency for the conduct of U.S. foreign affairs in Bolivia. Even if ceremonial or protocolary communications are made on a service to service basis, they should of course go through me, or be subject to my concurrence. On the substantive side, we now find that the two patrol craft are in fact to be substituted for a naval vessel already programmed under MAP which was to have replaced the existing MAP patrol craft, the J.F.Kennedy. The vessel which will now be deleted had been selected in a careful way as being the appropriate unit for use on Lake Titicaca. Again, we believe that we may be able to delete this vessel without political problems but cannot be completely sure.\nIn view of the foregoing, I would appreciate it if the Department would take up with the Navy Department my concerns in the manner by which this offer of patrol craft was made to Bolivia and to seek agreement on the points that I have made to insure the more orderly conduct of our affairs in Bolivia.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1974LAPAZ00080\nDate: January 04, 1974\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 28 MAY 2004\nConcepts: MILITARY SALES, NAVAL SHIPS, DIPLOMATIC COMMUNICATIONS, MILITARY CREDIT, MILITARY ASSISTANCE AGREEMENTS"

END SUMMARY.\n        \n            \n    \n    \n  \n\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE TELEGRAM\nUNCLASSIFIED\n\nCHARGE AND ADCM CALLED ON MINMINES LEMA JUNE 4 AT REQUEST OF MINCOORDINATION CAPRILES. CHARGE EXPLAINED TO MINMINES THAT FOLLOWING AMBASSADOR’S CALL ON MINMINES, EMBASSY HAD BEEN INSTRUCT- ED RAISE MATTER WITH MINISTER CAPRILES (SEE REF A) WHO, AFTER CONSULTING AND CONSIDERING FOR FEW DAYS HAD INFORMED CHARGE THAT HE SHOULD SEEK MEETING WITH LEMA. CHARGE AGAIN PRESENTED POINTS CONTAINED REF (B) AS HE HAD DONE IN MEETING WITH CAPRILES.\nLEMA RESPONDED BY RHETORICALLY ASKING WHAT TYE WAS CLAIMING AND WHAT HE WANTED. LEMA SAID HE HAD BEEN PAID MORE THAN HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN PAID SO HE COULD NOT BE SEEKING MORE MONEY. SAID MINISTRY OF MINES INITIALLY RECOMMENDED PAYMENT OF ONLY $US 700,000 AS VALUE OF EQUIPMENT, ETC., BUT, IN VIEW OF NEWNESS AND FRA-\n\n062219Z\nGILITY OF BANZER GOVERNMENT AND “PRESSURE” FROM JOHN CONNOLLY ON\nPRESIDENT BANZER, MORE LIBERAL INTER-MINISTERIAL ASSESSMENT ES- TABLISHED ABOUT \\(US 1,350,000 AS VALUE WHICH WAS SUBSEQUENTLY\nINCREASED (PRESUMABLY BY FINAL CABINET ACTION) TO ABOUT\\)US 1,450,000. TYE HAD THEN SIGNED QUIT CLAIM. 3. MINISTER SAID TYE COULD NOT WANT RESTORATION OF MIXED ENTERPRISE BECAUSE NEITHER COMIBOL NOR GOB WANTED TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH TYE. MINISTER SAID TYE WAS BADLY BEHAVED (MAL CRIADO) INDIVIDUAL WHO SO INCENSED SUBSECRETARY IN MINISTRY OF MINES THAT TYE WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FORBIDDEN ENTRY TO THAT OFFICE. 4. LEMA SAID THERE WAS NO POINT TO ARBITRATION BECAUSE THERE WAS NOTHING FOR TYE TO GAIN OUT OF IT. BESIDES, HE SAID, ARBIT- RATION WAS POLITICALLY DANGEROUS FOR HIM AS MINISTER, FOR GOB AND FOR U.S. –BOLIVIAN RELATIONS. SAID MIXED COMPANY HAD BEEN LEGALLY DISSOLVED AFTER COMIBOL PAID ABOUT $US 23,000. IN REGISTRATION TAXES TYE SHOULD HAVE PAID TO ESTABLISH MIXED COMPANY IN FIRST PLACE. TYE FAILED TO PRESENT HIMSELF AT ANY OF EMBOSA BOARD MEETINGS PRECEDING DISSOLUTION. ADCM ASKED WHETHER TYE’S LAWYER REQUESTED ARBITRATION BEFORE DISSOLUTION. MINISTER SAID HE DID NOT KNOW, BUT THAT AS MAJORITY STOCKHOLDER COMIBOL HAD RIGHT TO DISSOLVE COMPANY ON PERFORMANCE GROUNDS SPECIFIED IN CONTRACT. MINISTER NOTED THAT TYE FAILED BEAR HIS SHARE OPERATING LOSSES RUNNING ABOUT $US 70,000 PER MONTH AND THAT HIS MINISTRY HAD PREPARED $US 270,000 CLAIM AGAINST TYE WHICH INCLUDED TYE’S SHARE OF REGISTRATION TAXES AND OPERATING LOSSES. 5. CHARGE SAID ARBITRATION NEED NOT BE PUBLIC AFFAIR BUT COULD SERVE USEFUL PURPOSE OF CLEARING AIR. ASKED ADCM TO GIVE HIS IMPRESSION OF WHAT TYE CLAIMED OR WANTED. ADCM SAID HE UNDERSTOOD TYE HAD WANTED MINISTRY OF DEFENSE TO NOT EXERCISE ITS OPTION TO TAKE 51 PERCENT OF SHARES IN GIBRALTAR HUARI-HUARI IN RETURN FOR ASSUMPTION OF VARIOUS TYE DEBTS. SAID TYE MIGHT ALSO WANT SOME SORT OF TAX BREAK IN CONNECTION WITH HIS NEW ARRANGEMENT WITH NEW JERSEY ZINC. FINALLY, ALTHOUGH TYE HAD NOT CLEARLY PRESSED FOR IT, HE MIGHT WANT 45 PERCENT SHARE (BASED ON HIS SHARE OF EMBOSA STOCK) OF ANY NET ASSETS. 6. MINISTER SAID EMBOSA CHARTER CLEARLY STATES COMIBOL OWNS ALL EQUIPMENT OF FIRM SO NOTHING TO SHARE. TYE WAS TO HAVE 45 PERCENT SHARE OF EQUITY IN RETURN FOR CONTRIBUTING FINANCING. HIS PATENTED PROCESS WAS TO BECOME COMIBOL’S AFTER ONE YEAR. 7. MINISTER THEN SAID IMPC CONTRACT HAD BAD ODER FROM VERY BEGINNING. CONTRACT HAD BEEN APPROVED DURING BARRIENTOS REGIME WHEN\n062219Z\nPARLIAMENT WAS FUNCTIONING. TYE HAD GOTTEN CONTRACT APPROVED WITH HELP OF INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL ALLIES. TORRES REGIME HAD NATION- ALIZED EXTERPRISE AND BANZER REGIME HAD MADE GENEROUS SETTLEMENT. TYE HAD BEEN UNABLE TO MEET REQUIREMENTS OF EMBOSA CHARTER, NOT BECAUSE MANAGEMENT CONTRACT WAS NOT SIGNED, BUT BECAUSE TYE WAS IN POOR FINANCIAL CONDITION. IBRD HAD BEEN READY AT ONE TIME TO LEND UP TO $US 9 MILLION TO EMBOSA BUT TYE COULD NOT PUT UP HIS PORTION OF FINANCING. TYE, IN FACT, OWED $US 1 MILLION TO PHILLIP\nBROS. ($US 500,000 OF WHICH WAS REALLY OWED THROUGH PHILLIP BROS. TO MITSUBISHI) AND HE STILL OWED SOME AMOUNT TO COMIGRA, ORIGINAL OWNERS OF HUARI-HUARI. REPAYMENT OF TYE’S $US 200,000 DEBT TO BANCO MINERO HAD BEEN POSTPONED FOR TWO YEARS BY MINDEFENSE OPTION CONTRACT. THIS POSTPONEMENT WAS CONTRARY TO LAW, INJURED BANCO MINERO, AND WAS ANOTHER GENEROUS FEATURE OF SETTLEMENT WITH TYE WHEN HE WAS PAID $US 1,450,000. FINALLY, TYE HAD ARRANGED WITH NEW JERSEY ZINC TO PAY DEBT TO BANCO MINERO FEW DAYS BEFORE EX- PIRATION OF OPTION CONTRACT. MINISTER LEMA CLAIMED HE DID NOT KNOW DETAILS OF TYE’S ARRANGEMENTS WITH NEW JERSEY ZINC OR LATTER’S EFFORTS FORM MIXED COMPANY WITH PRIVATE BOLIVIAN COMPANIES TO EX- PLOIT HUARI-HUARI MINE. LEMA WRYLY COMMENTED THAT OF $US 200,000 TYE BORROWED FROM BANCO MINERO ONLY $US 30,000 TO $US 40,000 HAD BEEN INVESTED IN DEVELOPMENT OF HUARI-HUARI WHICH WAS FAR RICHER MINE THAN MINA MATILDE. 8. MINISTER NOTED THAT BOLIVIAN LAW REQUIRED THAT MINES OR MINERAL DEPOSITS NOT BEING EXPLOITED OR WITHOUT DEVELOPMENT PLANS MUST REVERT TO GOVERNMENT. 9. ADCM STATED THAT BESIDES CLEARING AIR, ARBITRATION MIGHT SERVE TO AVOID ACTION MINISTER LEMA HAD MENTIONED IN EARLIER MEETING WHICH TYE HAD THREATENED, I.E., TO BLOCKADE OR HOLD BOLIVIAN TIN SHIP- MENT TO TEXAS SMELTER. MINISTER RESPONDED THAT TYE WAS NO BETTER REGARDED IN U.S. THAN BOLIVIA DUE TO HIS ASSOCIATION WITH FIRMS BROUGHT INTO BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS. MINISTER SAID TYE WAS AN ADVENTURER WHO HAD USED CONTACTS TO ACCOMPLISH HIS PURPOSES. 10. MINISTER CONCLUDED DISCUSSION BY REPEATING THAT HE SAW NO BASIS FOR ARBITRATION OR SIMILAR PROCEEDINGS.

End Summary.\n        \n                    \n          TAGS:\n          BDIS, EMIN, BL\n        \n                  \n    \n    \n  \n\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE TELEGRAM\nUNCLASSIFIED\n\nFirst contradiction is in first paragraph of Tye’s letter to Senator Bentsen dated November 30, 1973, wherein Tye states IMPC received half million dollars in compensation for nationalization of its property. Embassy will send ASAP translation and copy in Spanish of original receipt and document of payment signed by Tye and IMPC’s lawyer, Luis Soux, declaring and “confessing” they received check duly endorsed for US$ 1,447,066 which they recognize as just and fair indemnification for all its investments in Bolivia and those made in foreign countries for investigations related to treatment and mining of tin tailings.\nSecond contradiction in same paragraph is that “we had to give 51 percent interest in another mine which was not nationalized.” We have not found any written evidence in documents that Huari-Huari deal related to IMPC settlement. According documents we hold, Tye gave on March 16, 1972 to Ministry National Defense a two year option contract as of March 1, 1972 to purchase 51 percent of stock of Gibralter Huari-Huari Corporation. Option expires on March 1, 1974.\nThird contradiction is that according to Ref A, item A, Tye claims EMBOSA’s legal status ‘impersoneria juridical’ established August, 1973, but appears it was first recognized May 3, 1972 by Supreme Resolution 162872 and according De La Rocha was finally implemented by Supreme Resolution No 163617 dated August 16, 1972.\nFourth contradiction is that according to COMIBOL and MINMINES records, plant operated from May to November, 1972 and produced 139.9 metric tons fine tin content in concentrate form whereas according Ref A Tye claims was operating from February to July, 1972 and produced 154 metric tons fine tin. Under COMIBOL management plant operated from January to December, 1971 and produced 249.0 metric tons of fine tin equivalent.\nAccording to Dr. Luis Soux, IMPC’s previous lawyer, and IMPC’s present lawyer, Dr. Hugo De La Rocha, neither attorney had requested arbitration in writing before liquidation of EMBOSA. Soux states on September 27, 1973 when board of directors liquidated EMBOSA, he made oral appeal for arbitration. De La Rocha now trying to obtain legalized record of minutes of this meeting. Embassy notes that board resolved to liquidate EMBOSA on meeting of September 12, 1973, which perhaps would have been time indicated for Soux to have made written appeal for arbitration. As reported in Ref B, Tye sent letter to MINMINES stating he had tried to see Minister “to try to reach an arbitrated agreement.” According De La Rocha this written expression of interest in arbitrated settlement can also be taken as request for arbitration.\nFYI. De La Rocha on January 23, 1974 told EMBOFF he had advised Tye to forget EMBOSA and concentrate on Gibralter Huari-Huari affairs.\nIn view of many contradictions and questions of fact in this case we believe USG position at this time probably could be no more than simply to urge GOB to submit dispute to arbitration as specified in Article 41 of Statute of Incorporation and we are not even sure we can do this. We not entirely convinced even this opportunity to use arbitration has not already been lost to IMPC. If it turns out that minutes of last stockholders’ meeting do not show that IMPC rep requested arbitration then Article 41 may not be available to IMPC because request may have been made during life or liquidation phase of EMBOSA. We do see some possible merit in De La Rocha’s view that COMIBOL should have referred matter to arbitration rather than proceeding directly to liquidation. End FYI.\nAction requested: That Department lawyers carefully examine statutes, decrees, resolutions and other documents in this case and advise what position we should take. (These documents being pouched under airgram). In meantime, lawyers may wish review what we believe are salient clauses sent Ref D.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1974LAPAZ00590\nDate: January 29, 1974\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 JAN 1960\nConcepts: NATIONALIZATION, ARBITRATION, MINING INDUSTRY, INDEMNIFICATION, INDUSTRIAL PLANTS, METAL PRODUCTS"

This is the sixth such trial in Bolivian history since 1857, and none so far has resulted in convictions. On the eve of the hearing several political parties expressed solidarity with the proceedings. That same day, Banzer went on television to defend his regime and pledge he would go along with the verdict of the people and history. On the first day of the trial, PS-1 Deputy Marcelo Quiroga presented the lengthiest and most detailed of the two accusations made in the time span allowed. While no one can predict at this time how these proceedings will end, the possibility exists that the process—particularly if the Armed Forces become involved as an institution—could jeopardize the consummation of Bolivia’s transition to democracy.\nIntroduction: If any informed observer of Bolivia had predicted in the summer of 1977—at the very height of the Hugo Banzer dictatorship—that in only two years a constitutionally-elected Congress would have President Banzer on trial for high treason, misuse of funds, and violation of human rights, the observer would have been regarded as something of a doomsday freak. We are not aware that anyone made such a prediction, but the event, highly unlikely in 1977, is now taking place, for the much heralded trial in the Congress began August 30, 1979. It is the sixth time since 1857 that trials of high government officials have taken place. No convictions have ever occurred.\nBackground: A. In 1857, General Cordova’s entire cabinet was charged with violating the Constitution and the civil rights of the people. The Congress dismissed the charges. In 1893, similar accusations against President Mariano Baptista—one of Cordova’s accusers—were also dismissed by the Congress. That same year, General Daza was accused of treason during the war with Chile, graft, and violation of the Constitution. He was never tried. Returning from Europe to defend himself, Daza was assassinated in 1894. José Manuel Pando and his cabinet was charged in 1913 with the same crimes as Cordova and Baptista, and like them was never tried. Finally, in 1917, the trial of President Ismael Montes led to a riot that kept his accusers away from the Congress. He too escaped prosecution.\nB. Presently, charges against public officials can be brought under the 1967 Political Constitution, and the Law of Responsibilities (passed October 23, 1944, modifying a similar law enacted October 31, 1884). The process calls for:\n\nAccusations against a President or other high government officials “for crimes committed in the exercise of their functions” must be presented in open session to the Congress;\nAfterwards, the matter is to be promptly referred to a special commission to study the evidence, and within 15 days, present Congress a recommendation to either dismiss or sustain charges;\nThe accused may defend themselves in person or through deposition. Once their defense is heard, Congress must decide, by a two-thirds vote, whether to dismiss charges or refer the matter to the Supreme Court. (Note: The Congress is not bound by the commission’s recommendation.)\nThe Supreme Court, acting on evidence and testimony previously presented, issues a decision and imposes a sentence.\n\nC. In preparation for the trial of the former President, the Congress petitioned the GOB to provide detailed information on persons detained, persecuted, and exiled during the Banzer years. When given advance notice of this request, the press reports the Interior Minister asked for 90 days to prepare a reply. Oscar Zamora, MNR Senator from Tarija and PCML leader, reportedly refused to grant the Minister’s request and trenchantly suggested the information be expeditiously obtained from Armed Forces J-2 files, which he qualified as the most complete source of political information.\nD. On the eve of the trial, August 29, many political parties appeared in favor of it. Press reports quoted Casiano Amurrio, leader of the PCML and Deputy for Cochabamba, “The MNR alliance is not out for revenge, but only seeks justice be done and the law respected.” Qualifying those remarks, Jose Harb, an MNR leader and Deputy for La Paz, cautiously told reporters he could not comment on the position the alliance would take at the hearings. Jaime Tapia Alipaz, ADN leader and Deputy for La Paz, told the press his party will seek to include under the present trial all governments since 1952, particularly the governments of Paz Estenssoro, Siles Zuazo and Ovando. He reasoned these governments repeatedly violated the rights of individuals, and hoped the present trial would prevent recurrence of past errors. Finally, Banzer in a televised statement August 29 defended his regime, asked the trial be conducted in an atmosphere of respect and proper decorum, and claimed he would\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1979LAPAZ07472\nDate: August 31, 1979\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 jan 1960\nConcepts: TREASON TRIALS, CENTRAL LEGISLATURE, POLITICAL LEADERS, COURT PROCEEDINGS"

It is our belief that this step will enhance Bolivia’s international standing and ability to realize its most important diplomatic and economic objectives. There should be no question of our support for the democratization process which is continuing, and our admiration for the accomplishments realized thus far. My government also shares a deep concern for the possible consequences which might arise through indiscriminate, uncontrolled sale of tin. It is for this reason that the United States is committed to consult, prior to any sales, with the International Tin Council as well as with the tin producers. President Carter has assured the Government of Bolivia that we will manage any eventual disposals from the strategic buffer stocks so as to safeguard against disruption of the tin market and the economic position of producers.\nThe United States believes that consumers and producers share an interest in a healthy world tin market. It has thus been a matter of increasing concern to us that in recent years world tin production has lagged behind demand despite rapidly increasing prices. World consumption of tin metal is expected to exceed production again in 1979, and world stocks are well below historical levels. In view of these considerations, we believe it is in the long run interest of all signatories to the International Tin Agreement to compensate for this shortage and thus discourage further substitution of alternative materials for tin.\nThe legislation now pending in the United States Congress would provide authority for the disposal of 35,000 tons of tin, of which up to 5,000 tons is authorized for a contribution to the International Tin Council buffer stock. The sales would be carried out over a period of three or more years. It is the position of the United States that a disposal program which is conducted with careful regard for developments in the world economy, and in consultation with the International Tin Council and tin producers, will not jeopardize the foreign exchange earnings which are so vital to the continued economic growth of Bolivia.\nIn closing, I wish to reiterate that the United States is deeply aware of the need to ensure the democratization process in Bolivia. I am sure you share this view and will be reassured that the legislation now being considered by the United States Senate would not disrupt the world tin market. Sincerely, Paul H. Boeker.

The plan has begun with the destruction of bridges, blockage of roads, interruption of railroad lines and explosion of grenades in urban centers, concluding with the criminal sabotage of our petroleum production, all of which is aimed at creating a state of confusion and chaos wherein the cities would suffer shortages of goods, provoking the people’s anger; at this moment when the conditions were ripe, the extremists would call for an armed uprising, converting our country, as it is easy to imagine, into a battlefield of ideological and armed struggle in South America.\nIt is not, hence, a plan which seeks a new type of government appropriate for our nation’s problems, but rather one which seeks to establish in our country, aside from a puppet government, a new center of continental extremist activities; it is a conspiracy which intends to regain for extremism the positions recently lost in America, and, this action, as we have previously pointed out, is being carried out in our country because of its special political and geographic situation. The plan is not new or original; we have suffered before from the same type of attempts. The popular armed rejection of extremist aggression is still fresh in our memory.\nThe solid integration of the Armed Forces, the Nationalist Revolutionary Movement, Bolivian Socialist Falange, the Farrientist Forces and the citizens of the countryside and of the cities does not reflect the mere permanence in power of interests or partisan groups but rather the deep ideological, nationalist conviction which unites them together in order to keep Bolivia from any international dependency, within the framework of Christian moral and spiritual principles, with full awareness of the responsibilities the workers and employers share in the common enterprise which their work involves. Some narrow-minded persons who do not understand this scheme try to channel their personal ambitions through a dozen “displaced” persons and want to surprise us with ingenious commando-style coup attempts. Those who consciously or unconsciously are engaged in this new adventure, which ultimately favors the international conspiracy, are hereby warned that my government will be inflexible in imposing the existing legal sanctions.\nIn the same manner that in August 1971 the Armed Forces supported the popular effort to guard our national integrity and call a halt to the excessive acts of anarchy, today in the presence of these serious acts I take my place to fight this new battle for our nation.\nTo the farmers, to the workers in the cities, to the miners, to all those who are deceived in their good faith, whom the extremists are trying to induce to act against the forces of public order, converting them into cannon fodder, I make a call so that they will become aware of the seriousness of this situation, realizing that the solution to the problem of supply and salaries can not come via an armed confrontation or the blocking of roads, but only by cooperating with Government’s effort to obtain more resources in order to face the world food shortage. It is necessary to establish clearly that the line of the Government is firmly outlined and explained in my New Year’s Message, an”\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1974LAPAZ00627\nDate: January 30, 1974\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 JAN 1960\nConcepts: PRESIDENT, MARTIAL LAW, GOVERNMENT OVERTHROW, FOOD SHORTAGE, SPEECHES, ECONOMIC CONTROLS, CIVIL"

The US delegation played an active role and was successful in promoting greater concern over the need for budgetary discipline and the need to stop the proliferating number of international meetings and subsidiary bodies of ECLA. A very good resolution on decentralization (restructuring) of UN activities was adopted which incorporates the concept of redeploying resources from New York to the regional commission to enable the latter to effectively assume their growing responsibilities (text to be sent septel). Only remaining business on Committee II agenda is consideration of Uruguayan draft resolution on energy which is still before Latin American Working Group and adoption of Committee II report which will be forwarded to Plenary. End summary.\nCommittee II, which was assigned to review the Secretariat’s activities and work program, has completed virtually all items on its agenda and dealt with 25 draft resolutions. In addition to the resolutions noted in reftel, the following nine resolutions were also considered:\n\n\nCOM II/19: Withdrawn\nCOM II/21 SPONSOR: Venezuela SUBJECT: Amends Resolution 13 US POSITION: Yes, with reservation COMMENT: Objectionable language on graduation removed, US supported consensus\nCOM II/22: Withdrawn\nCOM II/23: SPONSOR: Argentina, Costa Rica, Cuba, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Venezuela SUBJECT: Economic and social projections US POSITION: Yes\nCOM II/24 SPONSOR: Uruguay SUBJECT: Decentralization of UN activities US POSITION: Yes COMMENT: Approved with US amendments on transfer and redevelopment of resources.\nCOM II/25 SPONSOR: Bolivia SUBJECT: The needs of children and the shaping of the coming generations within the framework of the development process.

THE PRIMARY COMPLAINT IS WITH REGARD TO FULFILLING CONTRACTS TO PROVIDE WHEAT AND FLOUR TO BOLIVIA AT PRICES AGREED IN 1973 AND WITH APPARENT ARGENTINE FOOT- DRAGGING ON CONSTRUCTION OF AHIGHWAY FROM POTOSI TO THE ARGENTINE BOFDER AT BERMEJO. THE GOB IS CONVINCED THAT THIS STANCE REFLECTS GOA PIQUE WITH THE GO’S DEMANDS TO INCREASE PRICES ON NATURAL GAS AND PETROLEUM SUPPLIED TO ARGENTINA. THIS SUTUATION MAY BECOME MORE AGGRAVATED AS A RESULT OF THE RECENT SIGNATURE OF AN IMPORTANT AGREEMENT BETWEEN BOLIVIA AND BRAZIL WHICH COMMITS BOLIVIA TO SELL LARGE QUANTITIES OF NATURAL GAS AND PETROLEUM TO BRAZIL IN EXCHANGE FOR LARGE AMOUNTS OF BRAZILIAN ASSISTANCE. TALKS TO STRAIGHTEN OUT THE COMPLEX OF ARGENTINE-BOLIVIAN ECONOMIC RELATIONS (OTHER EXAPLES, GOA WANTS BOLIVIAN IRON ORE AND GOB WANTS ARGENTINE AVGAS AT LOW PRICE) HAVE NEVER GOTTEN OFF THE GROUND.

Strengthening contacts with key individual through close proximity over a period of time. B. Being able to present points to further local CASP and CPM courses of action. C. Using local media to convey to a larger audience the key points brought out during the discussions. D. Using the STAG’s as entre to groups with whom one would not ordinarily have easy access.\nNone of these benefits would accrue to Bolivia if we participated in Peru’s seminar. Under the circumstances, we prefer not to participate in the proposed Vogel, Pollack, Turpin seminar. Like Quito, we feel our money could be better spent in a locally produced seminar later in the fiscal year. We are consulting with Economic/Commercial Section on practical aspects to be covered and will submit details and STAG requests later.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1974LAPAZ00162\nDate: January 09, 1974\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 JAN 1960\nConcepts: PERSONNEL TRAINING, DRUG CONTROL, MEETINGS"

THIS REPRESENTS A MAJOR CHANGE IN THE GOVERNMENT’S LABOR POLICY SINCE THE DISESTAB- LISHMENT OF THE COB HAD BEEN A KEY TACTIC IN THE BANZER REGIME’S STRATEGY OF KEEPING THE LABOR MOVEMENT DIVIDED.\nTHE MINISTER OF LABOR HAS INDICATED IN A NUMBER OF STATEMENTS ON THIS ISSUE THAT TO BE ACCEPTABLE TO THE GOVERNMENT THE COB WOULD HAVE TO BE REORGANIZED AS AN APOLITICAL ORGANIZATION STRICTLY DEVOTED TO TRADE UNION MATTERS. THERE IS SOME SUPPORT FOR THIS VIEW AMONG CERTAIN LABOR ORGANIZATIONS WHO BELIEVE THAT THE COB STATUTES GIVE DISAPROPORTIONATE VOTING STRENGTH TO THE MINERS AND FACTORY WORKERS. MODERATE TRADE UNIONISTS WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SEE ORGANIZATIONS NOT STRICTLY TRADE UNION SUCH AS STUDENT GROUPS AND “FREE PROFESSIONALS” SEPARATED FROM THE COB. THE MINERS FEDERATION IS, OF COURSE, OPPOSED TO ANY CHANGES IN THE COB’S STATUTES.\nCOMMENT: THE REOPENING OF THE COB WOULD STRENGTHEN THE BARGAINING POWER OF THE LABOR MOVEMENT MANYFOLD AND INEVITABLY ENABLE THE MOVEMENT TO PLAY A MORE EFFECTIVE ROLE AS CRITIC\n\n021911Z\nOF THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL POLICIES OF THE GOVERNMENT.

Country Perception of Illicit Narcotics Activities and its Control Efforts\n(LOU) As of 1978, Bolivia’s perception of the narcotics problem might be described as maturing. Political leaders know that they have a problem, but in a year of electoral campaigns, fraud at the ballot box and military coups, there has not been the will on the part of the GOB to enforce key measures. Most glaring has been the failure to enforce the law which calls for the destruction of unregistered new plantings of coca. While we continue to urge action, there is no prospect that the present caretaker military government will do anything effective. We believe, however, that the chances of action from an elected government, scheduled to take over in August, are good. For 1978, and up to the present, political and other major concerns have overshadowed the drug problem in the minds of Bolivian leaders. The broader spectrum of Bolivian business, social and educational leadership, with some exceptions has only begun to appreciate that cocaine is a menace to this society as well as to the US. Firm conviction that something must be done soon to protect Bolivian society is still lacking. Embassy believes, nevertheless, that awareness of the problem has heightened during the past three years. On the positive side, the GOB with US help has considerably enhanced the capacity of the DNSP and Customs to take effective action against traffickers and cocaine processors. While this was not reflected in the very slight increase in seizures in 1978 (236 kilos of sulphate and HCL) as compared with 1977 (210 kilos of sulphate and HCL), there has been a notable increase during Jan.-Mar. 1979 (over 160 kilos of sulphate and HCL). The DNSP has also pushed ahead with the registration of coca merchants, transporters and retailers, and expects to open checkpoints at 25-50 locations along the coca farm-to-market routes. If effectively and honestly operated, these checkpoints, given Bolivia’s limited road network, could prove a significant deterrent to uncontrolled, illegal coca shipments. In short, the GOB does perceive coca and cocaine as a threat and the US does get cooperation. In 1978, however, due to an unfortunate mix of politics, corruption and inefficiencies, the GOB was not prepared to make the hard decisions needed for a full-scale crackdown on traffickers and illegal plantings. (End LOU.)\n\nUS Interest\n\nIn cooperation with the GOB, the US hopes to achieve (1) a reduction of coca production to the level of legal consumption (about 12,000 MT) and (2) a decrease in illegal exports of cocaine by a high percentage.\nA. Progress: We cannot point to significant progress in 1978 in terms of either reduction of coca plantings or of seizures of cocaine. The indications are, in fact, that plantings increased and, while we have no reliable estimates, it is likely that illicit cocaine exports also increased in 1978. Definite progress can be reported, however, in studies, research and data-gathering essential to a successful crop diversification/coca reduction program. Under the “Agricultural Development in Coca Zones” project, the Felt-Needs Study, aerial photography of the coca areas, the “Multidisciplinary Study” and the coffee productivity and sanitation campaign in the Yungas were completed. Construction of the La Jota Experimental Station in the Chapare has progressed substantially and the cacao productivity and sanitation campaign is well under way. Regarding enforcement, the most significant step forward was the beginning in October of the DNSP program, assisted and supported by the Mission, to register and license all dealers and merchants and coca. Scheduled for completion in March 1979, the registration will open the way for greatly improved controls on coca movements and marketing. (Peruvian narcotics authorities visiting Bolivia in December were highly impressed with this initiative.) In addition, DNSP territorial coverage and communications were improved as well as detector dog capabilities. The DNSP, with its own US-trained officers, conducted its first in-country narcotics training course. The Embassy also completed an extensive narcotics strategy paper, with a reassessment of our programs and a proposal for the establishment of a GOB coca marketing board, an “Estanco”. The board, by purchasing and marketing all or most of the Bolivian coca crops, would assure an adequate supply of coca at reasonable prices for legal users (chewers primarily) while the overall crop is reduced as a result of crop diversification and enforcement programs.\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1979LAPAZ02940\nDate: April 04, 1979\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 jan 1960\nConcepts: NARCOTICS, ANNUAL REPORTS"

THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THESE REASONS IS THAT BOLIVIA INEVITABLY WILL BE A FACTOR IN ANY CONFLICT BETWEEN CHILE AND PERU. WITH PROPER ENCOURAGEMENT AND SUPPORT, BOLIVIA COULD PLAY A CONSTRUCTIVE ROLE AND PERHAPS AN IMPORTANT ONE IN PREVENTING CHILEAN-PERUVIAN TENSIONS FROM GETTING OUT OF HAND. OUR CONSULTATIONS MIGHT HELP PRECLUDE BOLIVIA FROM MAKING AN IRRATIONAL MOVE TO SUPPORT ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER AND COMPLICATE THE ISSUES EVEN FURTHER.\nANOTHER IMPORTANT REASON IS THAT THE PRESENT BOLIVIAN GOVERNMENT, WHICH TOPPLED AN EXTREMIST AND HOSTILE REGIME, IS VERY FRIENDLY TO US; DISPOSED TO COOPERATE WITH US ON INTERNATIONAL ISSUES; AND IS MOVING TOWARD OPENING ITS DOMESTIC POLITICAL PROCESSES. THESE CONSULTATIONS WOULD HELP ASSURE CONTINUED BOLIVIAN SUPPORT FOR OUR POSITIONS, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, WOULD PROVIDE A USEFUL SHORING UP OF PRESTIGE FOR THE BANZER REGIME. I BELIEVE BANZER HAS A GOOD CHANCE TO STAY ON UNTIL ELECTIONS SOMETIME IN 1975,\n\n032232Z\nBUT HIS ABILITY TO GOVERN EFFECTIVELY DURING THIS TIME AND\nTO KEEP THE PROCESS OF CONSTITUTIONALIZATION ON THE TRACK WOULD BE ADVANCED IN THE MEASURE THAT HIS PRESTIGE IS AUGMENTED. THIS WOULD BE IN OUR INTEREST.\n\nA THIRD REASON APPLIES TO ALL THE SMALLER COUNTRIES IN THE HEMISPHERE, I.E., OUR NEW DIALOGUE SHOULD BE CARRIED ON WITH ALL THE COUNTRIES, NOT JUST THE BIG ONES, OR WE MAY IN THE PROCESS OF CONSULTING WITH THE “KEY” COUNTRIES OFFEND THE SMALL ONES, PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN OUTSPOKENLY FRIENDLY. THIS WOULD BE PARTICULARLY TRUE IN BOLIVIA’S CASE WERE OUR TEAM TO VISIT PERU AND CHILE AND NOT BOLIVIA.\nTHERE ARE SOME GOB-GROUPS IN EXISTENCE NOW THAT HAVE POLICY PLANNING FUNCTIONS AFFECTING FOREIGN POLICY, SUCH AS THE COMISION MARITIMA, THE CONSEJO POLITICO NACIONALISTA, THE ALTO MANDO MILITAR, AND THE AS YET UNSTAFFED ADVISORY COUNCIL TO THE FOREIGN MINISTRY. NEVERTHELESS, EACH OF THESE HAS CERTAIN DRAWBACKS, AND IT PROBABLY WOULD BE BETTER IF THE GOB FORMED A SPECIAL GROUP OF DECISION MAKERS AND PLANNERS TO MEET WITH OUR TEAM. THIS WOULD NOT PRESENT A PROBLEM. ON THE CONTRARY, IT WOULD PROVIDE USEFUL PUBLICITY HERE AND ENSURE THE KIND OF PARTICIPATION THAT WE WANT. I WOULD IMAGINE THAT SUCH A GROUP WOULD BE CHAIRED BY THE UNDER-SECRETARY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS, MARCELO OSTRIA, AND COMPOSED OF SENIOR MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES, FORMER FOREIGN MINISTERS SUCH AS ALBERTO CRESPO AND OTHER EXPERTS DRAWN FROM THE GROUPS MENTIONED ABOVE.\nCERTAINLY THE GOB WOULD WISH TO TALK ABOUT ITS PROBLEM OF LACK OF ADEQUATE ACCESS TO THE SEA AND THE CURRENT TENSIONS BETWEEN CHILE AND PERU WHICH MIGHT BEAR ON THIS PROBLEM. ANOTHER THEME OF INTEREST TO BOTH SIDES IS OUR STOCKPILE POLICY ON STRATEGIC ITEMS AND HOW BOLIVIA CAN COOPERATE IN THAT POLICY. BOLIVIA OF COURSE WOULD WISH TO DISCUSS CUBA POLICY, AND WOULD BE RECEPTIVE TO DISCUSSING WAYS TO UNDERCUT STEAMROLLER TACTICS BY THE LDC’S IN INTERNATIONAL FORA. AS THE DEPARTMENT KNOWS, BOLIVIA CONTINUES VIGOROUSLY TO OPPOSE THE RE-ENTRY OF CUBA INTO THE OAS AND TAKES VERY SERIOUSLY OUR PLEDGE TO CONSULT WITH OAS MEMBERS BEFORE WE CHANGE OUR CURRENT CUBA POLICY. WE COULD USE THE\n\n032232Z\nOPPORTUNITY TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE FOREIGN PLICY OF BRAZIL, ARGENTINA AND VENEZUELA AS SEEN THROUGH BOLIVIAN EYES.\n\nI BELIEVE IT WOULD BE PRUDENT, AT LEAST IN THE EARLY STAGES OF THESE CONSULTATIONS, TO STAGGER THE VISITS TO PERU, CHILE AND BOLIVIA SO THAT IT DOES NOT APPEAR THAT WE HAVE DECIDED TO TAKE AN ACTIVE PART IN SETTLING THE PROBLEMS INVOLVING THESE COUNTRIES. FOR THE DOMESTIC\n\nPOLITICAL REASONS MENTIONED ABOVE, IT WOULD BE PREFERABLE TO SCHEDULE THE VISIT TO BOLIVIA EARLIER RATHER THAN LATER.\n\nPLEASE ADVISE.

Padilla’s receding speech stressed that he and the armed forces had now done exactly what they promised to do – restore Bolivia to constitutional rule. Guevara promised a government of national conciliation, but regretted that apparently not all groups would participate in his yet-to-be formed cabinet. His major tasks, Guevara said, will be confronting Bolivia’s economic crisis and reforming the electoral laws to provide for a second round popular vote in the May 1980 elections. This modest inauguration and its indications of the pragmatic evolution of Bolivia’s young democracy are most encouraging for U.S. interests. End summary.\n\nInterim president Guevara’s inauguration address was short and conciliatory. He noted that his government emerged from exceptional circumstances, a deadlocked indirect election, and commended the flexibility and maturity of the major party leaders in resolving an impasse that in other eras of Bolivian history would have ended in violence.\n\n\nHis political task, Guevara said, was to avoid confrontations and violent solutions. His government should therefore be a symbol of national consensus, and his central task would be to consolidate the constitutional process already in train and to resolve some of the political and administrative problems that have been postponed. In that regard he enlisted the support of all sectors – the parties, the armed forces and the unions – and emphasized their right to speak out and propose their own ideas in participating in the resolution of Bolivia’s problems. He proposed to reform the electoral system to create an independent electoral authority, to install a modern system to tabulate promptly the results of the popular vote and to provide a second round popular vote if necessary to assure that a candidate gets a majority of the popular vote.\n\n\nGuevara called for unity and strength within the armed forces to reinforce the constitutionalization process. He paid special tribute to Padilla, noting that the latter’s place in Bolivian history had been firmly established, a reference which invoked a strong round of applause.\n\n\nOf foreign policy, Guevara stated that an effort would be made to resolve the sea outlet problem. Formulas would be developed and submitted to a national consensus. At the same time, Bolivia would maintain a policy of openness in its external relations, emphasizing states and not ideologies. He reaffirmed his country’s primary objective of maintaining good relations with its immediate neighbors.\n\n\nGuevara said his government would examine and attack the causes of Bolivia’s economic crisis rather than symptoms. He alluded to the tremendous size of the country’s external debt, and lowered production of petroleum and minerals, as well as the crisis in the modern agricultural sector. But he noted that a transitory government could not resolve all the problems. He would propose medium and long term programs to resolve the problems, but emphasized that it was not up to the government alone to tackle them, but everyone’s task. He exhorted the Congress, political alliances and fronts, and leaders of all sectors to bring their influence to bear on helping make the right decisions to resolve these problems.\n\n\nGuevara did imply some specific actions in discussing the great deficit in the country’s balance of payments. He said “almost immediate action” was needed to reduce this deficit. He also implied that he would seek renegotiation of Bolivia’s external debt, which he termed unsupportable. Guevara also said petroleum product prices have to reflect costs.\n\n\nIn concluding, Guevara said his purposes must be to get Bolivia moving again and build a bridge between the past and the future.\n\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1979LAPAZ06747\nDate: August 08, 1979\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 jan 1960\nConcepts: INAUGURATION, INTERIM GOVERNMENT, SPEECHES"

The BAF has no viable air defense capability. The BAF defensive air order of battle includes eight very old and marginally armed and maintained F-86 aircraft of which possibly 4 could be launched simultaneously and thirteen even older T-33 and TF-33 aircraft, of which 6 or 7 could be launched simultaneously. It is estimated that only 50 percent of these aircraft could be turned to a second sortie. The BAF clearly and seriously recognizes its primary mission to defend, in conjunction with the other Bolivian Armed Forces, the territorial sovereignty of Bolivia. At the same time, the BAF, and all of Bolivia’s neighbors (except perhaps Paraguay), realize that the BAF does not possess a deterrent defensive capability. The regional and sub-regional tensions stemming from historical and contemporary territorial disputes provide the BAF a bona fide requirement to purchase a limited number of modern fighter aircraft. The BAF (and also the other armed forces) believe that the possibility of conflict within the region is real. This view is held not only by the high command, but also the company and field grade officers. The GOB has not expended funds to modernize the BAF fighter fleet since the modest acquisition of the Korean War vintage F-86 aircraft from Venezuela in the early 1970’s. Further, the impending withdrawal of the armed forces from direct involvement in the government, with the avowed purpose of returning to the barracks, has placed very heavy internal pressures on the BAF leaders to initiate a token (albeit costly) modernization program. Bolivian leaders cannot ignore or discount such pressures in light of the imminent return to non-military government, nor should we. In addition to the F-5, BAF acquisition studies are known to include consideration of Mirage and Jaguar aircraft.\nB. Acquisition of the F-5 aircraft would permit the BAF to organize and train a modest air defense force. While the effectiveness of such a force is debatable in light of the overwhelming materiel superiority of Bolivia’s neighbors (excepting Paraguay), it would provide Bolivia with a marginal air defense capability. The provision of F-5 aircraft to Bolivia would not exacerbate the arms imbalance of the region. In fact, it would serve to reduce the present imbalance. Neither would such an acquisition serve to introduce for the first time this weapon system to South America.\nC. The BAF, with appropriate training, should be able to employ and maintain the F-5 system. We estimate that two or three civilian technical representatives would be required for the first 2 years after acquisition. This would enable the BAF to initially maintain and subsequently develop a satisfactory maintenance capability. The BAF has pilots who, with normal familiarization training in CONUS, would be fully qualified to pilot the F-5.\nD. GOB has requested USG financing or sale approval with subsequent commercial financing. The BAF desires the most reasonable interest rates possible with a 2 year grace period followed by an extended repayment schedule (15 to 20 years total). The BAF Command expressed verbally, in conversations with US Ambassador Boeker and members of this MILGP, that the repayment of such loans would come from the normal BAF yearly budget, supplemented if and as necessary by income derived from commercial utilization of the BAF fleet of C-130s and F-27s.\nE. We believe Bolivia will attempt to finance such a purchase through some medium term borrowing arrangement from commercial sources. Repayments, not to begin before 1981, which, if the case, would postpone any immediate impact upon the Bolivian economy. Amortization would derive from the regular Air Force budget which BAF sources indicate will not require any appreciable increase because of inter alia increased revenues from their air cargo service. Moreover, if Bolivia is determined to go through with this Air Force upgrading, purchase of the F-5’s would constitute a burden of considerably less dimension than would purchase of known alternative aircraft (i.e., a purchase of $75-100 as opposed to approximately $200 million).\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1979LAPAZ06049\nDate: July 13, 1979\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 jan 1960\nConcepts: FIGHTER AIRCRAFT, MILITARY ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS"

Her roots are in the Nationalist Revolutionary Movement (MNR), which she joined when it began to gather force in 1946. Regarded for many years as “leftist” and labor-oriented, she split from the mainstream MNR before the 1960 general elections to help Juan Lechin form the Revolutionary Party of the National Left (PRIN). In early 1978, she veered away from Lechin to found her own PRIN faction. In 1979, she and her small band of followers became affiliated with Victor Paz Estenssoro’s MNR alliance. Her subsequent emergence as president of the lower house–a circumstance that led to her being selected Chief of State on Nov 16–was more attributable to Paz’ machinations than to any of her own.\nA secretary and accountant by training, Gueiler early achieved recognition through her willingness to adopt and defend labor and far left political positions. At the same time, however, she is not widely regarded as an ideologue or dogmatist–particularly since assuming the chairmanship of the Congress. Perhaps of interest in this regard, she recently told an EMBOFF that she had come to realize that contentious social and economic issues take on more complex dimensions when one is in a position of responsibility. Her leadership in Congress has been steady, at times courageous, but never brilliant. Some of her critics maintain that she is “controlled” by Victor Paz; others that she is guided by Beijing-line Communist leader Oscar Zamora, with whom, in a non-doctrinaire fashion, she has been politically associated in the past. Given the heavy influx of MNR Alliance figures into her cabinet, the Embassy’s assumption at this juncture is that Paz’ influence will be greatest. But Ms. Gueiler is a strong-willed woman, and, insofar as she feels within her depth, she will probably try to plot her own course.\nMore checkered is Ms. Gueiler’s personal history, which, inevitably, has been distorted by rumor and deliberate slander. In the early 1960’s, for example, while serving as Bolivia’s Charge d’Affaires in Bonn, she reportedly was declared non grata, perhaps for trying to propagate her political views or for engaging in contraband. Twice divorced, she married her first husband, a Paraguayan surnamed Perez, when he was being held prisoner in Cochabamba during the Chaco War. Her second husband, Edwin Moeller, currently heads up a rival PRIN faction which was affiliated with Hernan Siles’ UDP in the last elections. Prior, between and after her marriages, Ms. Gueiler is widely rumored to have engaged in liaisons with a number of prominent political figures. While these stories may not be true, they have conferred on her a “racy” reputation which her appearance would otherwise belie. According to biographic data now circulating in La Paz, she was born on Aug 28, 1926. We estimate that this date is about ten years off. She has at least one daughter, Maria Teresa Perez Gueiler, about 45, and a grandson studying at a university in Florida.\nIn addition to some of the above information, Ms. Gueiler’s curriculum vitae lists these accomplishments: –Primary and commercial studies in Cochabamba at the Instituto Americano (degree in accounting). –Languages: Quechua, German (fair) and English (fair). –Joined MNR in 1946. –Subsecretary of Ministry of Peasant Affairs. –Twice Lower House deputy. –Charge d’Affaires in Bonn. –Chief of departmental “command” (Cochabamba) of MNR. –Chief of national command of MNR. –Author of book entitled “Women and Revolution.” –Candidate for Vice President of the Republic. –Vice President of the Leftist Revolutionary Front (FRI). –Invited to visit Albania and the People’s Republic of China as representative of the Bolivian Woman’s Union. –President of the Chamber of Deputies. –President of the Congress. –Interim President of Bolivia.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1979LAPAZ09990\nDate: November 19, 1979\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 jan 1960\nConcepts: PRESIDENT, INTERIM GOVERNMENT, BIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION"

THESE DIS- SATISFACTIONS, SHARED BY STUDENTS, PROFESSORS AND MANY OUTSIDE OBSERVERS OF THE UNIVERSITY SCENE, WERE CRYSTALLIZED BY THE RESIGNATION MAY 9 OF THE RECTOR OF SAN ANDRES UNIVERSITY IN LA PAZ. SUBSEQUENTLY, A CHAIN REACTION F APPOINTMENTS TO AND RESIGNATIONS FROM THE RECTORSHIP, COUPLED WITH STUDENT PROTEST MEETINGS, LED TO THE CLOSING OF THE COUNTRY’S LARGEST UNIVERSITY ON MAY 21. ALTHOUGH SAN ANDRES UNIVERSITY IS NOW SCHEDULED TO REOPEN ON JUNE 3, THE POWER STRUGGLE BETWEEN COMPETING POLITICAL FACTIONS WITHIN THE UNIVERSIT SYSTEM HAS ONLY JUST BEGUN, AND IS LIKELY TO INTENSIFY OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. END SUMMARY.\nTHE SURFACE CALM IN BOLIVIA’S UNIVERSITIES OVER THE PAST\n\n01 OF 02 311516Z\nTWO YEARS HAS HIDDEN A GROWING MEASURE OF DISCONTENT WITH\nSOME OF THE CHANGES IN THE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM WHICH WERE BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE 1972 FUNDAMENTAL LAW OF THE BOLIVIAN UNIVERSITY. THIS LAW RESTRICTED UNIVERSITY AUTONOMY TO THE REALM OF ADMINISTRATIVE AND ACADEMIC AFFAIRS, WHILE CREATING A NEW NATIONAL COUNCIL OF HIGHER EDUCATION (CNES) TO OVERSEE THE OPERATION OF THE NATION’S NINE UNIVERSITIES. OTHER ASPECTS OF THE POST-1971 UNIVERSITY SCENE WHICH HAVE BRED DISSATIS- FACTION AMONG STUDENTS, PROFESSORS AND MANY OUTSIDE OBSERVERS INCLUDE THE INCREASED ROLE OF POLITICAL PARTIES IN THE UNIVER- SITIES, A RAPID GROWTH IN THE NUMBER OF SUPERNUMERARIES OCCUPYING ADMINISTRATIVE POSTS WITHIN THE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM AND THE FAILURE TO HOLD ELECTIONS FOR STUDENT LEADERS.\n\nTHE RESIGNATION OF RECTOR FELIPE HARTMANN OF SAN ANDRES UNIVERSITY (UMSA) IN LA PAZ ON MAY 9, FOLLOWING A SERIES OF CLASHES BETWEEN HARTMANN AND CNES OVER THE UNIVERSITY AUTONOMY ISSUE, CRYSTALLLIZED MUCH OF THE EXISTING DISCONTENT OVER THE FUNCTIONING OF THE BOLIVIAN UNIVERSITY SYSTEM. WITH HARTMANN’S REPLACEMENT BY VICE RECTOR MARIO AGUILAR, A MEMBER OF THE FALANGE PARTY, FSB MEMBERS WERE RAPIDLY NAMED TO A SERIES OF HIGH-LEVEL ADMINISTRATIVE POSTS WITHIN THE UNIVERSITY. THIS ATTEMPT TO GIVE A PARTISAN POLITICAL CAST TO THE NATION’S LARGEST UNIVERSITY PROVOKED A THREAT FROM THE MNR TO WITHDRAW ALL OF ITS ADMINISTRATIVE AND ACADEMIC PERSONNEL FROM UMSA. FOLLOWING A SERIES OF HURRIED POLITICAL CONSUL- TATIONS WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT, CHANGES IN THE COMPOSITION OF CNES WERE ANNOUNCED ON MAY 15-16 WHEREBY AGUILAR JOINED THAT BODY AND WAS REPLACED AS RECTOR OF UMSA BY COLONEL JOSE ZELAYA. ZELAYA, A PROFESSOR OF GEOGRAPHY AND ENGINEERING, THUS BECAME THE FIRST MILITARY OFFICER EVER TO HOLD THE POST OF RECTOR OF SAN ANDRES UNIVERSITY.\nSTUDENT REACTION TO THE APPOINTMENT OF A MILITARY OFFICER TO THIS POST WAS IMMEDIATE AND STRONGLY NEGATIVE. AT A PUBLIC MEETING CALLED BY THE STUDENT-ELECTED INTER-FACULTY COMMITTEE ON MAY 17, THE ASSEMBLED UMSA STUDENTS APPROVED RESOLUTIONS RE- JECTING BOTH ZELAYS AND CNES, AND DECLARED A 24-HOUR STRIKE. IN THE FACE OF STRONG OPPOSITION TO HIS NOMINATION, ZELAYA RE- SIGNED THE RECTORSHIP ON MAY 19, AND WAS REPLACED ON THE FOLLOWING DAY BY AGUILAR. STUDENT LEADERS NOW ATTEMPTED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE\n\n01 OF 02 311516Z\nOF THE CONFUSED ATMOSPHERE AT UMSA BY CALLING A MEETING ON MAY 21, AT WHICH THEY PLANNED TO DENOUNCE AGUILAR’S REAPPOINTMENT, CALL FOR THE ELECTION OF RECTORS BY STUDENTS AND PROFESSORS, AND APPROVE POLITICAL RESOLUTIONS IN FAVOR OF THE REOPENING OF THE COB AND DECLARING VISITING BRAZILIAN PRESIDENT GEISEL PERSONA NON GRATA. THIS MEETING WAS ABORTED BY A SQUAD OF FALANGE YOUTH, ARMED WITH TEAR GAS AND REVOLVERS, WHO CLEARED OUT THE SITE OF THE STUDENT ASSEMBLY IN A RAPID\nCOMMANDO-TYPE ACTION: SUBSEQUENT ATTEMPTS BY THE STUDENTS TO REASSEMBLE WERE DISPERSED BY THE POLICE. IN THE WAKE OF THESE EVENTS, INTER-FACULTY COMMITTEE LEADERS CALLED FOR A 48-HOUR STRIKE, AND WERE SUPPORTED BY SYMPATHY STRIKES AT THE CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY AND THE UNIVERSITIES OF COCHABAMBA AND SUCRE. ON THE SAME DATE, MAY21, THE RECTOR OF UMSA RE- SPONDED BY ANNOUNCING THE INDEFINITE CLOSURE OF SAN ANDRES UNVERSITY.\n\nTHE IMPORTANCE OF ACHIEVING A POLITICAL SETTLEMENT TO THE ONGOING UNIVERSITY CRISIS WAS IMPRESSED UPON THE GOVERNMENT BY THE INVOLVEMENT OF NEW GROUPS IN THE CRISIS IN SUCCEEDING DAYS. ON THE DAY OF THE UNIVERSITY’S CLOSURE, THE ARMED FORCES ISSUED A JOINT STATEMENT SUPPORTING COLONEL ZELAYA’S ACTIONS AND CALLING UPON ALL PARTIES TO THE DISPUTE TO REFLECT UPON THE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR ACTS: IN PARTICULAR, THE DOCU- MENT MADE CLEAR THE “FIRM DECISION” OF THE MILITARY INSTITUTION TO “CAUSE THE ESTABLISHED ORDER AND SUBMISSION TO THE PRINCIPLES OF AUTHORITY AND DISCIPLINE TO BE RESPECTED.” STATEMENTS BY GROUPS OF PROFESSORS AND PARENTS OF UNIVERSITY STUDENTS CALLING FOR THE REOPENING OF THE UNIVERSITY WERE SUPPORTED ON MAY 27 BY A COMBINED DECLARATIONOF SUCH KEY UNIONS AS THE MINERS, BREWIN\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1974LAPAZ03504\nDate: May 30, 1974\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 JAN 1960\nConcepts: LAW, DISPUTES, UNIVERSITIES, POLITICAL PARTIES, POLITICAL SITUATION, STUDENT DEMONSTRATIONS, MEETINGS,"

Stabilization Measures – There has been a strong reaction to the measures as they were originally announced. Paz has the votes necessary to avoid a congressional censure of the government, and Gueiler’s personal relationship with Juan Lechin will help in overcoming resistance to the decrees. There was greater opposition, however, on the part of the peasants and transport workers because food prices had remained frozen and gasoline was much more expensive. Guevara thought Gueiler would agree to some adjustment of food prices which would satisfy the peasants. B. The military, the real power in Bolivia, remain in their headquarters in Miraflores. The same people who supported Natusch are still in command and believe the real enemy of Bolivia is the Bolivian people. Democracy and the current military structure in Bolivia are incompatible because too many officers see themselves as having to guide the country (“tutelar de la patria”). Guevara also said that President Gueiler will have no influence over the December promotion, retirement and transfer list. C. Elections – It would have been better to tackle only economic problems during 1980, and leave elections for 1981. There is a danger that Paz will attempt to take advantage of his influence over the government for electoral purposes. Assuming Siles and Banzer will both be candidates, the 1980 elections will be a replay of those of 1979. The fact that the elections will not be general poses a problem because the terms of office for the president and vice president will no longer coincide with that of the Congress.\nAssistant Secretary Vaky observed that the failure of the Natusch coup will have a beneficial effect internationally, including on the Peruvians. He also said that what is happening in Bolivia is of great interest to the international community, especially with regard to the stabilization measures. He hoped this point could be conveyed to political party figures in La Paz.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1979STATE322132\nDate: December 14, 1979\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 jan 1960\nConcepts: DIPLOMATIC DISCUSSIONS, POLITICAL SITUATION, TRENDS"

Following is the text of the Foreign Ministry’s comments on the proposed toll increase.\nQuote: The Government of Bolivia would view with concern any increase in canal tolls and is opposed to any new charge for the following reasons:\n\nBolivia, because of its land-locked situation, bears the burden of a surcharge of more than ten percent on its foreign trade. This fact diminishes the competitiveness of its exports.\nLikewise, should the proposed toll increase take place, Bolivia would have to support an increase in the prices of its mineral and agricultural exports, the latter of which are at present starting to diversify Bolivia’s export situation. In the same manner, it would suffer damage to its import capability, in such areas as mining machinery, smelting equipment, agricultural and industrial machinery, etc. Therefore, in case an increase takes place, it is undeniable that Bolivia would suffer severely from both the direct and indirect effects of this measure. It should be emphasized that most of Bolivian foreign trade passes through the Panama Canal.\n\nPast experience teaches us that additional transportation charges give rise to adverse cumulative effects influencing the general level of internal prices for commodities and services.\nLikewise, it should be taken into account that Bolivia has been classified with the group of nations of least economic development, and for this reason, as well as because of its transitory land-locked status, it should receive preferential treatment.\nConsequently, the Government of Bolivia supports fully the resolution approved by the Special Committee for Consultation and Negotiation (CECON) which states that an increase in canal tolls would adversely affect “some import sectors” of the economies of the developing countries in Latin America, especially those which, because of their geographic situation, are users of the Canal.

We have used this technique before, e.g. for Under Secretary Newsom’s visit, and found it gets excellent coverage from local press.\nNeedless to say, substance, e.g. on tin, will have to be adjusted in the course of the Secretary’s visit, but we submit the following so the Secretary can consider the type of release we propose.\nBegin draft press release\n\nThe American Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, accompanied by Mrs. Vance, departed early Wednesday morning, October 24, after spending three days in La Paz as head of his country’s delegation to the General Assembly of the Organization of American States. In the course of his visit to Bolivia, the Secretary conferred with President Walter Guevara Arze and Minister of Foreign Affairs Gustavo Fernandez, who also hosted a dinner Sunday evening for Secretary Vance and Foreign Ministers of Andean Pact countries attending the OAS General Assembly.\nThe American Secretary of State also had the opportunity to talk to a number of foreign ministers attending the General Assembly to discuss matters of mutual interest.\nThe Secretary noted his great satisfaction at having had the opportunity to visit Bolivia for the first time and to get to know the leaders of its constitutional government. He also expressed his pleasure in meeting some of the leading figures of Bolivia’s armed forces who had successfully overseen the transition to elected, civilian rule. The Secretary indicated that he, like Bolivia’s other friends in the hemisphere, was impressed with the openness and viality of free political debate here and with the admirable respect for human rights in the current Bolivian scene.\nThe presence of the Foreign Ministers of the Americas in La Paz for the OAS Assembly was already, the Secretary felt, a reflection of the prestige Bolivia has gained. “Your return to constitutional rule has placed this country in the historical tide that is affecting the entire Andean Community and has lent enhanced political and moral force to its voice in many forums,” he said.\nThe Secretary noted that he had “long desired this opportunity to visit Bolivia and to meet with those whose contributions to Bolivian life he had followed from afar. Americans know Bolivians as a proud people, he said, whose heritage goes back to one of the great civilizations of the past and whose efforts in the last century kindled the movement for independence in Latin America. The Secretary observed that Bolivia had just accomplished the essence of democracy through free elections, selecting its leaders according to its own constitutional process.”\nIn his meeting with President Walter Guevara Arze, Secretary Vance assured him that the U.S. would fully meet its obligations under the International Tin Agreement and that disposals of surplus U.S. tin stocks will only be carried out in the closest coordination with your (the Bolivian) government, with those of other tin exporters and with the International Tin Council. Secretary Vance noted that any sales would be gradual, over at least a three-year period, to avoid disruption of the tin market.\nSecretary Vance underlined U.S. support for a resolution of Bolivia’s aspirations for access to the sea on a basis acceptable to the countries directly involved in the region.\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1979LAPAZ08894\nDate: October 19, 1979\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 jan 1960\nConcepts: TEXT, PRESS RELEASES, VISITS, MEETINGS"

GUTIERREZ MADE HIS STATEMENTS IN DEFENSE OF DR PAZ ESTENSSORO AND CIRO HUMBOLDT AS THE LEGITIMATE CHIEF AND SUB-CHIEF OF THE MNR BECAUSE HE WAS CONCERNED OVER THE RECENT GOVERNMENT-IMPOSED CHANGES IN THAT PARTY’S LEADERSHIP, FROM PAZ TO HUMBOLDT, AND HUMBOLDT TO GUILLERMO FORTUN. GUTIERREZ BELIEVES THAT THE GOB WILL NOW MOVE TO REPLACE AN IN- CREASINGLY WEAK FORTUN WITH RAUL LEMA PELAEZ, AND THAT AT AN APPRO- PRIATE MOMENT IT MIGHT ALSO SEEK TO BRING ABOUT HIS OWN REPLACEMENT AS FSB CHIEF BY A MORE COMPLIANT FALANNGE LEADER. THUS, GUEIRREZ” DEFENSE OF PAZ WAS IN REALITY A DEFENSE OF HIS OWN LONG-TERM INTERESTS.\n\nAS THE CHIEF OF A NATIONAL POLITICAL PARTY.\n\nAT THE SAME TIME, GUTIERREZ IS CONCERNED ABOUT THE GROWING EVIDENCE THAT PRESIDENT BANZER IS FOMENTING THE GROWTH OF THE BARRIENTISTA FRB AS A COUNTER-WEIGHT TO THE MNR AND THE FSB. FEARING THA THE BANZER GOVERNMENT’S LONG-TERM STRATEGY MIGHT\n\n042125Z\nINCLUDE SUPPORTING THE REGIME’S MILITARY CANDIDATE FOR THE\nPRESIDENCY IN 1975 WITH CAMPESINO VOTES AND A SUBSERVIENT CIVILIAN FRONT (POSSIBLY AN ALLIANCE OF BARRIENTISTA PARTIES), GUTIERREZ HAD THE FALANGE PROPOSE HIS OWN NAME AS A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, AND THEN CAME OUT WITH A STATEMENT FAVORING THE CONCEPT OF A JOINT FSB-MNR ELECTORAL SLATE. IN THIS WAY, GUTIERREZ HOPED TO GIVE WARNING TO BANZER THAT THE ULTIMATE RESULT OF THE POSSIBLE GOB STRATEGY OUTLINED ABOVE MIGHT, AS A LAST RESORT, BE THE OPEN OPPOSITION OF THE COUNTRY’S TWO MAJOR POLITICAL PARTIES TO THE GOVERNMENT’S OFFICIAL CANDIDATE.\n\nGUTIERREZ ALSO STATED THAT HE FAVORS A GENERAL POLITICAL AMNESTY, BEGINNING WITH INTERNAL AMNESTIES IN EACH POLITICAL PARTY, INCLUDING ONE IN THE FSB WHICH MIGHT INCLUDE DISSIDENT FALANGE LEADER CARLOS VALVERDE. ACCORDING TO OUR SOURCE, THIS STATEMENT WAS DESIGNED TO PLACATE GUTIERREZ’ BASE IN THE SANTA CRUZ AREA, WHERE VALVERDE IS ALSO VERY POPULAR. GIVEN THE PERSONAL UNPOPULARITY OF DR. PAZ ESTENSSORO IN SANTA CRUZ, GUTIERREZ COULD HARDLY SPEAK FAVORABLY OF PAZ WITHOUT ALSO SEEKING, BY WAY OF COMPENSATION, TO MAKE A GESTURE TOWARD ONE OF SANTA CRUZ’ EXILED FAVORITE SONS. GUTIERREZ’ ULTIMATE INTENTIONS TOWARD VALVERDE WOULD INCLUDE HIS RE-INTEGRATION INTO FALANAGE, AND SUBSEQUENT ASSIGNMENT TO A REMOTE DIPLOMATIC POST COMFORTABLY FAR FROM BOLIVIA.\nCOMMENT: EMBASSY BELIEVES CHANCES OF MNR SUPPORTING AN FSB CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT ARE VIRTUALLY NIL. IT IS MUCH MORE LIKELY THAT PAZ WILL APPROACH THE ELECTIONS ON TWO FRONTS, INCLUDING A CENTER LEFT COALITION WITH ITS OWN CANDIDATE, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME NEGOTIATING WITH THE GOB FOR AN ACCEPTABLE (TO THE MNR) OFFICIAL, MILITARY CANDIDATE. REALISTICALLY SPEAKING, THE ARENA OF BATTLE FOR THE POLITICAL PARTIES IS NOT THE PRESIDENCY, IT IS THE PARLIAMENT AND THE FUTURE GOB, AND THE SHARES IN EACH THE PARTIES CAN WIN.

NEW ALLIANCE WAS ANNOUNCED AT PRESS CONFERENCE CALLED BY MNRI SECRETARY OF ORGANIZATION RAMON CLAURE, PDC CHIEF BENJAMIN MIGUEL AND PRA LEADER WALTER GUERVARA ARCE, WHO ACTED AS SPOKESMAN FOR THE TRIO. STATED PURPOSE OF NEW POLITICAL GROUPING IS TO UNITE THREE CURRENTS OF “DEMOCRATIC AND POPULAR NATIONALISM OF THE LEFT” IN A COMMON FRONT WITH OTHER PARTIES AND ORGANIZATIONS OF SIMILAR TENDENCY. PDC-PARA-MNRI ALLIANCE PLANS TO CAMPAIGN FOR FREEING OF POLITICAL PRISONERS, RETURN OF POLITICAL EXILES AND CONSTI- TUTIONALIZATION OF THE COUNTRY VIA NATIONAL, MUNICIPAL AND UNIVERSITY-LEVEL ELECTIONS.\nADMINISTRATIVELY, ALLIANCE WILL BE DIRECTED BY COMMITTEE COMPOSED OF CHIEF, SUB-CHIEFS AND EXECUTIVE SECRETARIES OF THREE PARTIES. PRESIDENCY OF THIS NATIONAL COMMITTEE WILL BE EXERCIZED ON ROTATING BASIS FOR THREE MONTHS EACH DURING FIRST YEAR OF ALLIANCE, FOLLOWING ALPHA- BETICAL ORDER OF INITIALS OF THE PARTIES (E.E., MNRI, PDC, PRA). IN THEORY, THIS ALLIANCE WILL BE OF INDEFINITE\n\n162203Z\nDURATION, BUT IN PRACTICAL TERMS GUEVARA ADMITTED THAT ALLIANCE\nWILL LAST AT LEAST THROUGH 1975, AS PDC-PRA AND MNRI VIEW THIS PERIOD AS CRUCIAL TIME FOR DESIRED RETURN TO CONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNMENT.\n\nCOMMENT: MOST INTERESTING ASPECT OF THIS NEW OPPOSITION GROUPING, WHICH JOINS ESTABLISHED PDC-PRA ALLIANCE WITH SEMI- CLANDESTINE MNRI, IS PUBLIC REEMERGENCE OF PARTY OF SILES ZUAZO. DECISION OF THIS MAJOR LEFTIST POLITICAL FORCE TO UNITE WITH ITS SMALL, WEAK PDC-PRA ALLIES IS A SIGNIFICANT POLITICAL BREAK- THROUGH FOR ANTI-REGIME OPPOSITION AND WILL INEVITABLY DRAW RE- ACTION FROM BANZER GOVERMENT. CLAURE, WHO HAS BEEN TESTING GROUND WITH SEVERAL PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN RECENT MONTHS, WAS CAREFUL TO ASSURE PRESS THAT DOCUMENT SIGNED BY SILES IN BUENOS AIRES RECENTLY (TOGETHER WITH JUAN LECHIN AND EX- PRESIDENT TORRES) HAS NO RELATIONSHIP TO NEW PDC-PRA-MNRI PACT. HE FURTHER ADMITTED THAT NATIONAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF MNRI WITHIN BOLIVIA NOT YET FORMED.\nGOVERNMENT REACTION TO THIS DEVELOPMENT WILL PROVIDE IMPORTANT INDICATOR OF BANZER’S WILLINGESS TO ALLOW MODERATE LEFTIST PARTIES TO OPERATE OPENLY WITHIN NEW DOMESTIC POLITICAL ORDER. INITIAL GOB REACTION IS LIKELY TO BE CAUTIOUS, UNLESS MINISTRY OF INTERIOR DECIDES TO LAUNCH CRACKDOWN ON MNRI USING SILES-LECHIN-TORRES STATEMENT AS PRETEXT. SUCH A HASTY MOVE WOULD, HOWEVER, VIRTUALLY ELIMINATE ANY PROSPECT THAT MODERATE OPPOSITIONISTS CAN BE WOOED BY GOVERNMENT INTO PARTICIPATION IN FORTHCOMING NATIONAL CONSULTATIVE COUNCIL.

In La Paz the parade, described by the press as Bolivia’s longest and largest parade ever, lasted ten hours. Marchers carried Bolivian flags with a blue banner symbolic of Bolivia’s lost seacoast.\nIn his speech President Padilla castigated Chile for a “spirit of conquest” which still exists and accused Bolivia’s neighbor of “bad faith, arrogance, incomprehension, and intransigence” in recent negotiations. Consequently, he said Bolivia broke relations with Chile and “only when the very difficult conditions which they have tried to impose on us have disappeared, when the unchanging Chilean intransigence had gone, can we renew the dialogue.” Padilla lauded the heroes of Topater and called on Bolivians never to renounce their right to access to the sea. He described the sea outlet question as the greatest threat to the peace in the Americas. Nevertheless, “the Bolivian people are not animated by any feeling of hatred or resignation. Therefore, its love of peace should not be confused with fear or blind acceptance of injustice.”\nPadilla reiterated the commitment of the armed forces to return Bolivia to constitutional government and called for all Bolivians to be united and to fulfill their responsibilities.\nAn Argentine military delegation led by Vice Admiral Vanek participated in the ceremonies and a group of Argentine Air Force Canberra aircraft overflew La Paz to demonstrate support for Bolivia’s sea outlet claim.\nComment: Bolivia’s commemoration of the centennial of the Battle of Topater came off smoothly and without incident and provided another opportunity for the country to underscore its determination to negotiate a solution to the sea outlet problem. The tone of Padilla’s speech and the themes of the placards carried in the parades were all consistent with Bolivia’s oft-repeated statement that while it is determined to regain access to the Pacific it is also determined to do this via peaceful negotiations. The massive participation of the La Paz population in the March 23 commemoration was an impressive demonstration that (a) no cause incites and unites Bolivians like the sea-access issue and (b) this cause will not recede in Bolivian diplomacy, regardless of passage of time.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1979LAPAZ02637\nDate: March 28, 1979\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 jan 1960\nConcepts: WAR, COMMEMORATIVE CELEBRATIONS, ACCESS TO PORTS"

Minister Pereda complained that if USG had responded to GOB request sooner, GOB could have made arrangements to cover its requirements. Econoff conceded would have been helpful had we been able respond sooner but pointed out that (1) almost 50,000 M.T. PL-480 wheat still had not entered Bolivia, (2) these supplies should last until mid-April, 1974 which should afford GOB time to make other arrangements, and (3) flour was real short-term problem and possibility of importing flour under PL-480 had been discarded from time 1972 agreement had been under negotiation due to prohibitively high U.S. price delivered to Bolivia.\nEconoff offered help arrange commercial wheat sales in any way could. Minind/Com said would appreciate current wheat price quotes from U.S., what wheat available, where and when. Econoff then asked whether Minister believed it would be useful arrange for a U.S. wheat mission to visit Bolivia. Suggested that mission might be composed of one official from Department of Agriculture plus representatives of U.S. wheat brokers not represented in La Paz plus interested bankers. Minister said such mission might be useful.\nAction requested: (A) That USDA obtain price quotes and initial indications of quantities (of up to 60,000 M.T.) and locations of wheat available for shipping by March 1, 1974 and cable ASAP.

Though Bolivia does not have industry as large as Colombia, Venezuela, and Brazil, its industry is presently operating at close to 100 percent capacity with most companies carrying out and planning expansion. Therefore, we recommend the mission return from Brazil via La Paz.\nTextile industry is as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName of Firm\nEmploys\nManufactures\nSales\n\n\n\n\nManufacturas de Algodon, S.A.\n1,016\nTextiles and cotton threads\n2,850,000\n\n\nLanificio Boliviano Domingo Soligno S.A.\n735\nWool broad, woven fabrics, wool blankets, men suitings\n1,500,000\n\n\nManufacturas Textiles Forno S.A.\n490\nCotton fabrics, woolen fabrics, blankets, acrylic fabrics\n1,000,000\n\n\nSociedad Nacional Textil S.A.\n257\nCotton yarns\n770,000\n\n\nEstablecimientos Textiles Estatex S.A.\n169\nNylon fabrics, rayon fabrics, polyester fabrics\n1,200,000\n\n\nTextiles Asociados S.A.\n160\nWeaving synthetics fabrics\n650,000\n\n\nFabrica de Tejidos Jacquard Fateja S.A.\n109\nCotton fabrics, fiber and silk textile fabrics, brocades\n800,000\n\n\nIndustrias Silesia\n72\nMen’s hosiery, women’s stockings, shirts\n600,000\n\n\nTextiles Orientales S.A.\n110\nCotton cloths, textile bags\n268,000\n\n\nCombofla (Government wholly owned)\n101\nWool tops, fur clothing\n200,000\n\n\n\nIn addition, a group of Santa Cruz businessmen have formed a new firm (Hilados y Tejidos Santa Cruz, S.A.) to produce yarn. They estimate equipment purchase of $3.5 million. Part of the yarn output will be used to manufacture 3,000,000 bags yearly to store rice, sugar, corn, etc. A Medellin, Colombia firm (we have been unable to obtain name) was contracted to perform a feasibility study. We recommend that the Medellin local branch of Bank of America be contacted to obtain the company’s name so that mission members can discuss the Santa Cruz project. The new Santa Cruz company is to sign a contract on May 10, with the Medellin company which will proceed with equipment purchases and final plant design. The Santa Cruz group is still interested in discussing equipment requirements.\nThe Government of Bolivia (GOB) is planning a second yarn plant in Santa Cruz costing an unconfirmed US$15 million. This project is being financed under a US$25 million Bank of America loan to the GOB which presumably will relend to Corporacion Boliviana de Fomento (C.B.F.) which will arrange meetings for mission members with C.B.F.\nBolivia is an exporter of cotton. Projected plants would process this raw material. The Santa Cruz area produces virtually all Bolivian cotton as follows:\n\n\n\nPeriod\nHectares#\n(100 lbs. units)\n\n\n\n\n1952/53\n200\n572\n\n\n1958/59\n1,000\n15,000\n\n\n1968/69\n6,000\n90,000\n\n\n1969/70\n8,500\n120,000\n\n\n1970/71\n17,600\n228,000\n\n\n1971/72\n47,000\n335,000\n\n\n1972/73##\n60,000\n900,000\n\n\n\n10,000 sq. meters per hectare.\nEstimated\nNote: The percentage increase of both hectares and output from the period 1968/69 to 1972/73 was 900 percent or a yearly average of 58.5 percent (compounded). Expansion is still in motion.\nStatistics on the importation of textile machinery is not current. The latest two years available reflect imports of:\n\n\n\n\nTotal (CIF) World\nTotal (CIF) USA#\n\n\n\n\n1970\n833.1\n490.1\n\n\n1971\n745.9\n530.6\n\n\n\nUS $(000)\nThough the above figures are relatively low, our interviews with the La Paz companies listed in paragraph no. 2 indicate seven out of nine companies intend to expand their operations. As production of cotton increases, new companies will be formed to process yarn, and as the present La Paz firms are operating at close to 100 percent, there will be an increase in the importation of textile machinery of several million US dollars.\nAll companies interviewed expressed interest in new textile technology.\nAs most Bolivian textile engineers are European educated and equipment oriented, the mission would be in a position to develop US interests.\nAll companies expressed interest in discussing their equipment requirements with mission members.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1974LAPAZ02773\nDate: May 01, 1974\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 JAN 1960\nConcepts: n/a"

Minister took the position that GOB cannot take further action in the case unless the claimants or their attorney document the claim and present themselves to the Minister in support of the claim. On the other hand, Minister said some mix of monetary-land compensation might be warranted depending on solidity and value of claim. Embassy believes that claimants have not been entirely accurate in their correspondence or testimony and that outlook for a satisfactory solution to the case is poor unless claimants engage in direct negotiation. We recommend that Department present its view of the case directly to Chairman Poage.\n\nHouse Agriculture Committee or its chairman and some of its members appear to have taken almost at face value Moran’s statement (State 47381) that he was unaware of any good faith efforts to settle the case. We believe that, on the contrary, what appears to be a reasonable offer has been made and that neither Moran nor his principals have made any real effort to examine the offer or to negotiate a solution. According to Dr. Tapia of Sugar Institute (CNECA), neither Moran nor his principals have discussed specific parcels of land. It appears they could easily do so if they wished as Youngquist told EMBOFFs more than a year ago that he frequently travels to Bolivia where he is raising corn and, according to U.S. citizen residents of Santa Cruz, Applegate is in Santa Cruz as a farmer businessman once again.\n\nDepartment will recall that the Bolivian Government has not yet specified parcels of land. In its letter of December 18, 1973 (see La Paz A-029 of Feb 24, 1974) the Government only indicated three provinces where land is almost entirely in Government hands, as possible areas from which claimants could choose parcels. Two provinces are not served by roads, but a third is. One province, according to Dr. Tapia, is subject to flooding, but even Moran appears to admit that it is only partially subject to such flooding (State 47381). GOB expects (implicit in its letter and explicitly in statements to Embassy officers) that Moran or his principals will want to examine specific parcels in these areas before accepting or rejecting its offer.\nExact situation of land parcels does not appear to be an important issue if GOB agrees to allow claimants to sell land as Government officials have repeatedly told EMBOFFs (see La Paz 7048, for example). Moran’s insistence on a cash payment would also appear to be unjustified or immaterial if land is to be sold for cash. The real issue would be sale value of land offered in compensation.\nApparently GOB in the past has also tangibly shown its interest in according fair treatment to the claimants and in settling the case. GOB allowed Applegate to keep 500 hectares (1,235.5 acres) and offered bonds to compensate for the other 8,250 hectares (20,385.75 acres) nationalized in accordance with Agrarian Reform Law. It is worth recalling that Applegate and Youngquist originally purchased a total of about 16,700 hectares (45,098 acres) for about US$ 34,580 in 1951. (Amount may have been only US$20,748 if Applegate and Youngquist purchased Bolivian pesos at a “differential rate” of $B 101.00 per US$1.00 rather than the official rate of \\(B 60.6 per US\\) 1.00 then in effect). As only 8,250 hectares were taken from them, they presumably still have 8,450 hectares and may have since purchased additional land. Moreover, according to Moran’s letter of October 6, 1972 to Hector Ormachea (when he was Minister of Industry, Commerce and Tourism), Victor Paz, when he was President of Bolivia, awarded 5,000 hectares (12,355.0 acres) to Applegate and Youngquist. Thus, it appears that partial compensation at least has already been made and that Applegate and Youngquist may hold more than 13,450 hectares (33,234.95 acres) of Bolivian land even if title to this land is not perfect.\nOn the other hand, it appears that Moran and his principals may not have always acted in “good faith.” As a general proposition, they appear disinclined to negotiate on a friendly and direct basis with Government officials, preferring an arms length exchange of letters and a maximum exertion of compulsion through the United States Government whether it be through the State Department and Embassy, the White House or the Congress as our files amply demonstrate.\n\nLimited Official Use\n\nMoreover, it appears to us that Moran and his principals have been less than open and forthright with USG and GOB officials and House Agriculture Committee as indicated by instances cited below: A. Although GOB initiated action to take control of a portion of the claimants’ land (“affected”) on or about November 18, 1961, claimants did not inform Embassy until February 6, 1963. (Acting Assistant Secretary Torbut’s letter to Senator Ellender of January 8, 1968). B. Although State Department offered, beginning in mid-1966, to formally espouse their claim if claimants could properly prepare and document their case, they have never been able to do so to the satisfaction of State Department lawyers. (See Herman Kleine’s memorandum of July 6, 1971 to the Administrator). Despite this continuing inability or unwillingness to present a properly prepared and documented case, Moran has repeatedly claimed that State Department had agreed to espouse the case, carefully failing to add the condition on which Department would do so. (Summary of exchanges over past few years being airpouched. Moran’s letters of June 8, 1973; September 20, 1973; November 15, 1973; and January 11, 1974 all claim that State Department had agreed to espouse the claim). C. Moran repeatedly asserted that GOB had not made an offer or what could be considered an offer when, in fact, GOB had offered land which Moran virtually refused. (See Moran’s letters of June 8, 1973; September 20, 1973; September 25, 1973; October 3, 1973; November 6, 1973; November 15, 1973; and November 16, 1973). D. Moran repeatedly asserted that GOB had not replied to his offer when, in fact, GOB had stated as early as January 19, 1973 that any settlement other than in land would be impossible for it. E. Although Moran asserted repeatedly, and as late as January 11, 1974, that settlement in land was not possible because Applegate had suffered an accident and his ability to travel was limited, U.S. citizen residents of Santa Cruz report that Applegate has resettled in Santa Cruz as a farmer and businessman. Youngquist reportedly passes through Bolivia frequently because he has farming and other interests in the country.\nDCM and ECONOFF met with new MININD/COM, Sub-Secretary for Industry Pereira (Frontanilla) and Juan McLean and Dr. Tapia of Sugar Institute on March 27. Views of Chairman Poage were again presented. Bolivian officials insisted that they could not take further action unless claimants, or their fully empowered representative, were able to document their case and present it to the Ministry. They insisted that they did not have in their files the documentation they requested in their letter of March 1, 1974. (Embassy is gathering together all of the pertinent documents in its possession on this case and will send copies to the Minister to replenish his files). They did indicate for the first time that they might consider a mixed land and financial compensation if the case appeared to warrant it. They stated that Applegate/Youngquist land had little value when it was expropriated and that records of Okinawan Colony show it was virtually undeveloped and unfenced. None of these officials knew whether Applegate had or has effective control of the 5,000 hectares Moran stated in his letter of October 6, 1972 Ex-President Victor Paz (Estenssoro) had given Applegate, presumably in compensation for expropriated land.\nFinally, they stated that Bolivian Embassy in Washington had full information on the case, including Ministry’s most recent letter to Moran, and that they assumed Waters and Bolivian Embassy were cooperating.\nRecommended Action: Recommend that State Department official brief Chairman Poage on State Department’s view of this long and tortuous case, if this has not already been done. From our vantage point it appears that such a briefing should include the following points: A. Moran has never documented his case to the satisfaction of State Department lawyers, at least to the point that they would espouse the case, contrary to repeated claims by Moran that State Department had agreed to espouse the case; B. Neither Moran nor his claimants, to our knowledge, have sought for many years direct contacts with the Bolivian government except through the Bolivian Embassy in Washington; C. Claimants may be missing a good opportunity to resolve the case by direct negotiations as this GOB is probably better disposed to find a solution than most, if not all, of its predecessor governments; D. State Department and Embassy have been deeply involved in this case since 1963 when they were first appraised of it by claimants (contrary to claimants’ statements that Embassy has done nothing for them and that they are responsible for moving the case to the Congress).\nWe suggest that a timetable for reasonable action on the part of both sides in this case (GOB and claimants) be developed for USG use only to try to bring this longstanding case to a satisfactory conclusion. If Department believes such a guideline might be useful, it might be shown to Chairman Poage to indicate how we think the case could be resolved. Timetable might look something like the following: A. Claimants or their lawyer to present copies of all available documents in support of their case to GOB by June 1, 1974, or claimants or their lawyer to present an acceptable documented case to Department for espousal by June 1, 1974. B. Direct negotiations to begin by July 1, 1974. C. Evaluation of expropriated property to be completed by August 1, 1974. D. Specific parcels of land to be shown to claimants by September 1, 1974. E. Negotiations to be concluded by December 31, 1974.\nThis timetable is predicated on the assumption that claimants have some “valid” claim in USG’s eyes even if the claim is not fully documented or perfect in all respects. It also assumes that claimants may not have paid all taxes for which they were liable but that there still is a “net” value for which they have not been compensated.\nSuch a timetable might be acceptable to House Agriculture Committee as an appropriate guideline to reasonable performance by both sides and as a substitute for punitive action against Bolivia by the Congress before claimants have taken actions which we believe they should take.\n\nStedman\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1974LAPAZ02004\nDate: April 01, 1974\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 JAN 1960\nConcepts: SUGAR, DISPUTE SETTLEMENT, TRADE COMPLAINTS, LAND NATIONALIZATION, COURTS"

The state of siege places restrictions on internal travel, i.e., persons traveling from city to city in Bolivia must obtain written police approval. Furthermore, persons may not be out of doors after midnight in groups of three or more. Tourists are specifically advised to carry complete documentation with them at all times.\nThe GOB’s declaration of the state of siege came shortly after campesinos had blocked roads to the city of Cochabamba. These roads are now open and, although there may still be isolated incidents affecting public order in outlying areas, the security forces appear in control of the situation. The city of La Paz is calm.\nIf posts are approached for advice by persons intending to visit Bolivia, suggest you draw on foregoing, i.e., they should not be discouraged from coming to Bolivia, but should be advised of the possibilities of encountering difficulties in traveling between towns by road and the extra security precautions being taken by local authorities.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1974LAPAZ00674\nDate: January 31, 1974\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 JAN 1960\nConcepts: MARTIAL LAW, GOVERNMENT OVERTHROW, SECURITY CONTROLS, CURFEW, TRAVEL CONTROLS, CIVIL DISORDERS,"

END SUMMARY.\n        \n            \n    \n    \n  \n\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE TELEGRAM\nUNCLASSIFIED\n\nText requested longer than specified para 7 reftel but we feel is close to minimum possible given points reftel para 4 suggests be covered and Bolivia’s interesting foreign investment history. If Department wishes to adhere to maximum length specified para 7 reftel, we have no objection to Department eliminating portions of text it believes least important to businessmen.\nInvestment Climate: The government’s attitude toward new foreign direct investment is generally encouraging. Its attitude toward old direct investment has frequently been adverse. The government did not reverse nationalizations of Bolivian Gulf Oil Company, Mina Matilde Corporation (United States Steel and Phillip Bros.) and International Mineral Processing Company. It did nothing to discourage W.R. Grace from disinvesting.\n\nThe government’s attitude toward the private sector as a whole has been relatively favorable in the context of recent Bolivian history. The government, nevertheless, clearly favors limiting control of certain industries to the public sector, and important elements of the private sector believe the government has a distinct statist tendency as most recently indicated by its support for the entry of the Armed Forces (in the form of the Armed Forces National Development Corporation) into industry, mining, and agriculture.\nLaw No. 10521 of October 3, 1972, reserves control of Bolivia’s prospective iron and steel industry to the public sector. Law No. 7150 of May 7, 1965, reserves to COMIBOL mineral rights on any land within 5 kilometers of existing COMIBOL concessions. Government policy also appears to be aimed at keeping all new mineral smelting capacity under public sector control. On the other hand, the Investment Law of December 1971 makes clear that private foreign investors are to be treated the same as domestic investors. The law grants considerable tax and other concessions to new investments and guarantees, inter alia, repatriation of capital and profits. The 1972 Hydrocarbons Law has attracted seven foreign oil companies or groups and more are expected to sign contracts soon.\nThe government recently invited foreign firms to take up to 50,000 hectares each of Alto Beni land to put into cacao production.\nThe only known legal barriers to direct foreign investment are: (1) Under the Hydrocarbons Law, investments are limited to those permitted under service and operations contracts; (2) foreigners may not own property within 50 kilometers of Bolivia’s borders; and (3) the provisions of the Andean Foreign Investment Code, the full effects of which Bolivians are quick to point out, will not apply for some twenty years. Businessmen probably should assume that most of the Pact’s tariff, ownership and other restrictions, as well as benefits, will eventually be applied in Bolivia, although the government has not yet issued implementing regulations to Decision 24 on foreign investment. The only rules on local procurement (origin of inputs) are likely to be those worked out by the Pact. In addition to export goals for foreign investors established by the Pact, the Investment Law does provide that the scale of benefits an investment will receive will be determined in part by the potential foreign exchange earnings or savings of the project.\nThe government engages in weakly enforced price fixing on items important to the “popular economy.” This usually means basic food prices (flour, lard, vegetable oil, rice, coffee, sugar, etc.; gasoline, auto parts, tires, etc.).\nNationalizations began in Bolivia in 1936, resumed in the early 1950s and again in the late 60s and early 70s. The Banzer Government, which will have been in power two years and ten months in June 1974, has settled all clear cases of nationalization with despatch and good will. The Embassy believes, however, that the vagaries of Bolivian politics are such that renewed official respectability for nationalization is not unthinkable, particularly if there were to be a change in government.\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1974LAPAZ02576\nDate: April 24, 1974\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 JAN 1960\nConcepts: COMMERCE & INDUSTRY, FOREIGN INVESTMENTS, INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY REPORTS, INVESTMENT DATA"

As a result of decades of no exploration nor development of new mines, Bolivian tin production appears now to have entered a period of decline. Furthermore, subsidized prices of petroleum products plus the same historic pattern of long neglecting investment in favor of featherbedding and providing social benefits has brought Bolivia to the verge of becoming a petroleum importing nation. Bolivia’s sagging production of oil and tin combine to have a negative impact on Bolivia’s economic future. To offer a prospect of long-term success, any GOB economic reform program will have to address the structural problems of the tin and petroleum industries, as well as the immediate task of financial stabilization. End summary.\nAs is well known, with the exception of a predominantly subsistence agricultural sector, Bolivia’s visible economy is dominated by mining (17 percent of GDP, 70 percent of exports) and petroleum (4 percent of GDP). However, despite rapidly rising world prices for both commodities, the country’s production of each appears to be in secular decline, a problem that must be addressed by any future economic stabilization/reform program. (Bolivia’s still weeks-old new government has publicly acknowledged the tin/petroleum problem but, not surprisingly, hasn’t yet had time to even propose possible counter-measures.) Because of the obvious relevance the continuing slide in the production of these two key commodities holds for Bolivia’s economic future, we have put together a brief discussion of the basic problems facing both subsectors.\nPetroleum: Bolivia’s declining oil production (physical output peaked in 1973 and has fallen an average of 11 percent/year since 1976 and dropped a full 10 percent in the first quarter of 1979) is primarily the result of insufficient exploration, the consequence in turn of YPFB’s increasingly precarious financial position. (With total debt close to book value assets, the state oil monopoly is rapidly approaching technical insolvency.) And although the reasons for YPFB’s monetary difficulties include featherbedding, corruption, mismanagement and a history of excessive wage settlements, the principal problem is the artificially low price structure for its products: for example, 30 cents/gallon for gasoline, 6 cents/gallon for household kerosene. (It costs YPFB approximately $US 21 to produce a barrel of product it sells for less than $12.)\nClearly, the obvious first step the GOB should take is a major (at least 100 percent) increase in petroleum product prices. Production would still continue to fall for some time even if prices were raised and exploration sharply accelerated; however, an early price hike and stepped-up exploration would at least be a start. Unless a swap of Bolivia’s still excess gasoline for Brazilian kerosene, diesel and fuel oil can be arranged, the impending need to import product will have a substantial negative effect on the GOB’s already critical balance of payments situation.\nThere are two additional factors further clouding Bolivia’s bleak oil outlook. First is the possibility that despite even an heroic increase in exploration, the country may simply not possess much additional exploitable petroleum. As it is, most of Bolivia’s liquid petroleum is actually condensate produced in association with natural gas. To produce more needed liquids from existing wells requires producing more gas. The problem then becomes what to do with the gas–flaring it is wasteful and reinjection is costly. But the third alternative, selling the “excess” gas, is not presently promising. Argentina, Bolivia’s only current customer for piped gas (220 MCFD), is not disposed to increase its purchases. And the sale of Bolivian gas to Brazil (via a proposed pipeline from Santa Cruz to Sao Paulo) seems stalled until Bolivia makes the politically controversial decision either to pursue the project or drop it. Without a clear, positive decision on the gas sale to Brazil, Bolivia’s long-term prospects to balance its external accounts and meet its debts will remain cloudy.\nTin. Despite record world tin prices, Bolivia’s 1979 tin output is expected to fall several percentage points below the 30,200 metric tons produced last year. As with petroleum, the major cause of declining production is a lack of exploration that goes back at least to 1952, the year the bulk of Bolivian tin properties were nationalized. Still utilizing mines all of which were discovered decades ago, yields from both COMIBOL and many privately owned properties have steadily decreased while costs have continued to rise. The high cost of production could be attacked to a degree by a\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1979LAPAZ07474\nDate: September 01, 1979\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 jan 1960\nConcepts: TIN, PETROLEUM PRODUCTION, EXPLORATION, CORRUPTION, INVESTMENTS"

Natusch Busch, who declared “Military-Campesino Pact” in full force. Natusch identified himself with Banzer and extolled president as campesino’s friend. He said Banzer had told him that he hoped campesino would be president of Bolivia in near future.\nBanzer’s long and measured speech sought to explain economic measures as means of increasing income to campesinos, the producers of basic products. He said former low level of legal prices allowed profits to be made by speculators. He urged farmers to raise more now. Bolivia, he said, ironically, is fortunate in contrast to rest of world because it has shown itself capable of producing many things for domestic consumption, legal export and contraband. Banzer told the campesinos that Bolivia exports coca worth US $280 million which is destroying the youth of world and urged them to switch to other crops.\nBanzer pictured himself as deeply concerned for campesino welfare, a duty he claimed that came to him, in a sense, as posthumous charge from President Barrientos. He regretted that he could not speak Quechua so that he could speak of his love of them more expressively. He recognized poor state of Cochabamba economy but ticked off list of government measures that will improve future including distribution of free land in newly opened Chapare region and industrialization of Cochabamba itself. He said gift of tractors and plows is first step in making agrarian reform more meaningful by helping increase production.\nComment: Right at beginning of speech Banzer said that gift of tractors and plows was not (rpt not) response to recent “tragic events” in valley but circumstances argue otherwise. Banzer’s sincerity evident in speech, including reference to coca which helpful to US but not necessarily good politics for him. Nonetheless, both president and MINAG spoke in paternalistic tones. Crowd was large but only very small clack responded to speeches. Large numbers streamed toward exit when president began speaking until guards closed gate of base.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1974LAPAZ01488\nDate: March 12, 1974\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 JAN 1960\nConcepts: PRESIDENT, FARM EQUIPMENT, PUBLIC RELATIONS, SPEECHES, AGRICULTURAL WORKERS, LAND REFORMS"

END SUMMARY.\n        \n            \n    \n    \n  \n\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE TELEGRAM\nUNCLASSIFIED\n\nRole of UNDP, UN development system (Subpara A). The ResRep in Bolivia is a career UN civil servant who has served here for several years. He is knowledgeable and energetic. He strikes us as a forceful manager of NDP activities and as an effective coordinator of all other UN system technical assistance. He has a reputation for expressing quite frank opinions to GOB officials and to be willing to accelerate the termination of projects which are not being well supported. His relationship with his home office appears to be good.\nThe ResRep’s programming or coordinating role is much less significant vis-a-vis IBRD and IMF activities. Indeed, he has complained that visiting IBRD teams do not really seek to utilize UNDP’s resident capability. However, he has demonstrated certain creativity in developing projects and programs which combine technical and capital assistance efforts both within the UN system (e.g., a rural development project identification program involving the UNDP, FAO, IBRD) and between UN agencies and IDB (e.g. UNDP-financed telecommunications training geared to an IDB loan, and a UNDP/FAO/IDB project identification program).\nUNICEF did not participate in UNDP country programming exercise. However, ResRep states that UNICEF supports UNDP projects whenever possible. Furthermore, in addition to its traditional activities in cooperation with ministries of health and education, UNICEF has been developing interesting sectoral and regional approaches to development problems in which UNDP has been active, such as a combined UNICEF/UNDP rural development program in two departments of Bolivia and assistance to GOB’s Planning Ministry on development of National Nutrition Plan.\nCoordination of all external technical assistance (Subpara B). GOB has established three different points of coordination within host government (i.e. Ministry of Planning, Ministry of Coordination and soon-to-be established Institute of External Financing, in or under the Ministry of Finance) to which external donors can go as a group or individually on a range of programming or implementational issues. System is not yet working very well. Meanwhile, field representatives of external donors are now meeting monthly, rotating chairmanship. In addition, each donor is assigned leadership role for conducting inter-agency working level reviews of specific development sectors. UNDP ResRep, in this setting, is a creative member of external donor group; and, at times, has taken lead: (A) in stimulating the GOB to take a more active stance in established mechanism for coordinating external assistance, and (B) in seeking out opportunities for building upon the work of one external agency with complementary or follow-on assistance from other (e.g., UN support of a GOB training institute established with AID assistance).\nCountry program reviews (Subpara C). Over the past few months the UNDP and the Ministry of Planning have conducted a quick, rather superficial review of the ongoing UNDP support projects. Neither the Minister nor ResRep participated actively. Review was at initiative of Ministry of Planning. No significant actions were taken as result of review. ResRep states that, now that UNDP office is fully staffed (his deputy has arrived) and Ministry of Planning is settling down after two changes of ministers last fall, UNDP will undertake formal annual review of UNDP support projects.\nAppraisal of proposed projects (Subpara D). USAID/UNDP liaison procedures have been strengthened in recent months. ResRep is sending us, for comment, proposed projects for UNDP funding. However, given established five-year UNDP program, there does not appear to be much scope in near-term for influencing significant resource allocations within UNDP program. On our side, USAID is providing ResRep with copies of draft project agreements, PROPs, IRRs and CAPs to assure fullest opportunity for detailed project-by-project consultations on timely basis. We also consulted, relative to summary of DAP, which consultation, together with similar consultations on sector assessments, provide a means to reach overall agreement on strategy for major sectors. (Also see Part B above).\nProject implementation (Subpara E). In general, GOB financial and personnel contributions appear satisfactory for projects involving decentralized agencies or public enterprises (e.g., ENFE, Telecommunications Training Institute, Mining and Metallurgical Research Institute); but problems arise when: (A) project is dependent upon central administration (e.g., animal health in the Oriente); (B) project is located in outlying regions of country where living conditions make it extremely difficult to attract and retain qualified Bolivian technical personnel (e.g. in UNDP/FAO ABAPO-IZOZAG project in which in 1973 alone there was a 33 percent turnover of such personnel and in which UN fears that virtually all those returning from scholarship study abroad, who would be expected to implement the developmental phase of project, will resign on completion of their contractual obligation).\nExample of particularly successful project is Railways Organization and Administration, which laid basis for IBRD loan to National Railway System (ENFE) and remains integral element in loan implementation through provision of contract services to ENFE on reorganization, rationalization, and rehabilitation of system. Particularly weak project is Improvement and Development of Hydrological and Meteorological Services which was scheduled for period 1972-1976; but, as presently constituted, is now planned for termination mid-\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1974LAPAZ02148\nDate: April 05, 1974\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 JAN 1960\nConcepts: TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE, CERP 0008, DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS, US CONGRESSIONAL PRESENTATIONS, FOREIGN"

The best I can offer from Bolivia is the apparent costs of cumulative under investment in IMET over many years.\nThrough the 70s our investment in IMET in Bolivia has been a continual succession of reductions, to the point where our impact on the younger generation of officers is probably marginal. Even more important, this generation of officers has had its entire career up to August 1979 under military governments and has received its external training in Argentina, Brazil and Peru where the military also rules by some presumed natural right. This combination of factors has produced a group of officers who have no real comprehension of the role of the military in a democratic society and who are a glaring and dangerous anachronism in a society which has evolved toward a representative, constitutional government tenaciously defended by all sectors of the civilian society.\nIn the first half of November this dichotomy between part of the military and the civilian population led to a bloodbath in which a group of arrogant, rightist officers completely out of touch with their own country tried unsuccessfully to impose a military dictatorship on a society that would not have it. Probably 500 unarmed civilians were killed and the Bolivian military was disgraced in a tragic coup that should not have been—from anyone’s perspective.\nOne of the common characteristics in the group of middle-aged rightist officers who led the coup and in the younger officers who followed them was that they had virtually all had no training in the US, whereas US training or close ties were common among the more democratic-minded officers which the coup leaders pushed aside. If all goes as expected now, the middle-aged rightists and some of the more brutal younger officers involved will now be purged or pushed aside to unimportant assignments. But a very serious attitudinal crisis remains within the Bolivian military.\nWhile IMET or the shortage of it has obviously not been a principal factor in this recent tragedy, I do believe the very low level of the younger officer’s exposure to the US and US attitudes and the role and doctrine of the US military, combined with the dominance of Argentine training in particular, has been a factor behind the prevalence of arrogant, anachronistic, and dangerous attitudes on the military and politics among younger Bolivian officers. Among an older generation, many of whom spent cherished months at Fort Benning or in other US schools, there is a clear softer edge on their political views, a more humble concept of the military and a more rationalist approach to its role in society.\nThe following responds to the questions posed in paragraph 2, REFTEL, which are applicable to our situation and not addressed above:\n\nA. The IMET program serves the dual purposes of (1) introducing Bolivian officers to US military doctrine, tactics and training methods, and (2) providing Bolivian officers an in-depth real life exposure to US institutional ideals and the role of the military within the context of American democracy.\nB. As a result of the more comprehensive and expansive security assistance programs of the past, I and key members of my staff have been afforded excellent access to the military officials of the Bolivian armed forces. In almost all cases, the results of these direct contacts have been more congenial and fruitful where the contacted official has attended US military training in Panama or, especially, the US.\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1979LAPAZ10076\nDate: November 21, 1979\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 jan 1960\nConcepts: MILITARY TRAINING, DOCUMENTS, US CONGRESSIONAL PRESENTATIONS"

ALSO STATED THAT BOLIVIA NEEDS A MINIMUM MILITARY CAPABILITY TO DEFEND ITS TERRITORY\n\nIN EVENT BOLIVIA INVOLVED IN PERU/CHILEAN ARMED OPERATIONS. PRESIDENT SAID THIS CONCERN IS ONE HE HAS LONG HELD AND WOULD HAVE RAISED WITH PRESIDENT NIXON IF HE HAD MADE TRIP TO U.S. IN OCT. 1973 AND WOULD SURELY RAISE WITH PRESIDENT FORD WERE HE TO HAVE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE TRIP TO U.S. DURING HIS TERM IN OFFICE.\n\nON SEPT 5 GENERAL ROSSON, USCINCSO, AND I MADE EARLY MORING COURTESY CALL ON PRESIDENT BANZER. AFTER USUAL EXCHANGE OF PLEASANTRIES, GENERAL ROSSON NOTED IMPROVEMENT IN BOLIVIAN ARMED FORCES OVER THAT HE OBSERVED LAST YEAR. GENERAL ROSSON STRESSED MARKED PROGRESS IN MAINTENANCE CAPABILITY OF SEVERAL UNITS. ROSSON ALSO NOTED STRENGTHENED BALANCE OF PAYMENT SITUATION. PRESIDENT ACKNOWLEDGED DEGREE OF IMPROVEMENT BUT SAID THAT RATE OF ADVANCEMENT NOT AS FAST AS HE AND THE ARMED FORCES WISHED. HE ALSO NOTED THAT POLITICAL STABILITY WAS KEY FACTOR REQUIRED TO SECRET\n\nSECRET\n052142Z\nENABLE THE COUNTRY TO EXPLOIT ITS RICHES AND TO BENEFIT FROM\nPRESENT HIGH LEVEL OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE EARNINGS FROM MINERALS EXPORTS. PRESIDENT THEN SAID HE HAD A DEEP-SEATED CONCERN WHICH HE HAD HELD FOR A LONG TIME AND WISHED TO TELL US ABOUT BECAUSE IT IS A MATTER OF GRAVE IMPORTANCE TO BOLIVIA. HE SAID HE HAS BEEN AND IS TROUBLED ABOUT THE NEAR-TERM PROSPECT OF ARMED CONFLICT BETWEEN PERU AND CHILE AND THE PROBABLE INVOLVEMENT OF BOLIVIA.\n\nPRESIDENT BANZER SAID THAT HE HAD HAD THE OPPORTUNITY DURING HIS 25 YEARS OF MILITARY SERVICE TO MEET AND KNOW PERUVIANS AND CHILEANS, MILITARY AND CIVILANS, FROM LOW-RANKING TO HIGH AUTHORITIES. HE SAID HE HAD ATTENDED CONFERENCES, BEEN ON MISSIONS, AND SERVED IN OTHER COUNTRIES SUCH AS THE U.S. AS MILITARY ATTACHE, AND HAD GOTTEN TO KNOW PERUVIAN AND CHILEAN THINKING ABOUT ONE ANOTHER. RECENTLY HE HAD HAD PRIVATE CONVERSA- TIONS WITH PRESIDENT VELASCO OF PERU AND PRESIDENT PINOCHET OF CHILE. BOTH MEN EXPRESSED TO HIM FEELINGS WHICH BANZER HIMSELF SAID HE HAD OBSERVED ARE STRONGLY HELD BY THE PEOPLE OF BOTH COUNTRIES. IN THE CASE OF PERU, THERE IS A FERVENT DESIRE TO RECONQUER TERRITORIES LOST IN THE WAR OF THE PACIFIC. IN THE CASE OF CHILE, THERE IS A FIRM CONVICTION THAT IT WILL DEFEND TERRITORIES NOW UNDER ITS SOVEREIGN CONTROL. PRESIDENT BANZER SAID THAT HE HAS CONCLUDED THAT IN THE SHORT OR IN THE MEDIUM TERM THERE WILL BE ARMED CONFLICT BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES. HE IS CONVINCED THAT EVEN THOUGH BOLIVIAN POLICY IS NEUTRALITY, HIS COUNTRY WILL BE INVOLVED AGAINST ITS WILL. HE NOTED, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT A PERUVIAN MILITARY OFFICER NOW HOLDING A HIGH POSITION IN THE GOP, WHEN A MEMBER OF THE INTER-AMERICAN DEFENSE BOARD SOME YEARS AGO, HAD REVEALED TO HIM, WHEN HE WAS MILITARY ATTACHE IN WASHINGTON, PERUVIAN WAR PLANS WHICH INVOLVED USE OF BOLIVIAN AIR SPACE. BANZER SAID THAT THE PERUVIAN PLANS INCLUDE THE USE OF AIRPORTS BUILT BUT NOT NOW USED (HE SAID THAT HE HIMSELF KNOWS NONE OF SUCH AIRPORT) TO LAUNCH AIR STRIKES FROM PERU INTO BOLIVIA TO PASS SOUTH BEHIND THE BOLIVAN CORDILLERA AND THEN INTO CHILEAN TERRITORY. PRESIDENT BANZER NOTED FURTHER THAT THE PROBLEM IS NOT MERELY A THREE-CORNERED PROBLEM INVOLVING BOLIVIA, CHILE, AND PERU, BUT WILL INVOLVE MANY OTHER LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES. BRAZIL WILL SURELY BACK CHILE. PARAGUAY WILL SYMPATHIZE WITH BRAZIL AND CHILE BECAUSE OF ITS IDEOLOGICAL COMPATIBILITY. THE ARGENTINE POSITION IS NOT NOW CLEAR BECAUSE OF THE MUDDLED SITUATION THERE. SECRET\n\nSECRET\n052142Z\n\nPRESIDENT BANZER SAID THAT THE PERUVIAN/CHILEAN PROBLEM IS NOW SEVERELY AGGRAVATED BY THE TOTALLY OPPOSITE IDEOLOGIES OF THE TWO COUNTRIES. HE ALSO NOTED THAT THE ARMED FORCES OF BOTH COUNTRIES HAVING TALKED ABOUT RECONQUEST AND DEFENSE FOR SO MANY YEARS NOW HAVE A PASSIONATELY HELD DOCTRINE. HE SAID THAT HE HAS EVIDENCE THAT PERU HAS ATTEMPTED TO INFLUENCE DOMESTIC POLITICAL EVENTS IN BOLIVIA TO BRING ABOUT A REGIME MORE COMPATIBLE\n\nWITH THE PRESENT ONE IN LIMA. WHILE HISTORY MIGHT SUGGEST THAT BOLIVIA WOULD SIDE WITH PERU BECAUSE THEY BOTH LOST IN THE WAR OF THE PACIFIC, THE PRESENT IDEOLOGICAL SITUATION IN PERU PROMPTS BOLIVIA TO ADOPT ITS BASIC POLICY OF NEUTRALITY. PRESIDENT BANZER SAID THAT PERUVIAN PRESIDENT VELASCO TOLD HIM THAT BOLIVIA MAY WORK OUT AN ACCESS TO THE SEA WITH CHILE, BUT IT WOULD BE WORTHLESS IF IT INCLUDED FORMER PERUVIAN TERRITORY BECAUSE PERU INTENDS TO RECONQUER THAT AREA.\n\nPRESIDENT BANZER STRESSED THE FUNDAMENTAL POLICY OF BOLIVIA THAT IT BE NEUTRAL IN THE EVENT OF CONFLICT BETWEEN PERU AND CHILE, BUT HE EMPHASIZED THAT BECAUSE BOLIVIA MIGHT INEVITABLY BE INVOLVED AND HAS LIMITED CAPABILITY TO DEFEND ITS TERRITORY, IT NEEDS A GUARANTEE, BOTH MILITARY AND MORAL, OF A FRIENDLY AND STRONG COUNTRY. THE U.S. IS THE OBVIOUS CHOICE AMONG BOLIVIA’S FRIENDS TO PROVIDE THIS GUARANTEE. ALSO HE SAID THAT BOLIVIA NEEDS A MINIMUM MILITARY CAPABILITY TO PROTECT ITS TERRITORIAL SOVEREIGNTY IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT. HE SAID THAT HE WOULD BE DERELICT IN HIS DUTIES IF HE DID NOT ENSURE THAT BOLIVIA’S FORCES ARE AT LEAST ABLE TO MOVE TO THE FRONTIERS TO PROTECT THEM AGAINST INCURSIONS FROM EITHER PERU OR CHILE. HE SAID THIS SUBJECT HAD BEEN RAISED LY IN THE MARCH 1974 COCHABAMBA CONSULTATIVE MEETING BUT HAS BEEN KEPT OUT OF THE BOLIVIAN PRESS. HE SAID THAT THE ISSUE IS ONE WHICH HE CANNOT RAISE PUBLICLY IN BOLIVIA BECAUSE THE BOLIVIANS WILL BELIEVE THAT HE IS SEEKING TO EXPLOIT THE SITUATION TO MAINTAIN HIMSELF IN OFFICE. IN THIS REGARD, HE SAID THAT HE AND HIS GOVERNMENT ARE FIRMLY WEDDED TO HOLDING ELECTIONS IN 1975 AND TO TURNING THE GOVERNMENT OVER TO THE ELECTED PRESIDENT.\nPRESIDENT BANZER ASKED GENERAL ROSSO AND ME TO TRANSMIT TO THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT FOR SERIOUS CONSIDERATION HIS PERSONAL APPEAL FOR A GUARANTEE OF BOLIVIAN SECRET\n\nSECRET\n052142Z\nNEUTRALITY AND FOR THE NECESSARY MINIMUM MILITARY DEFENSIVE CAPABILITY, BASED ON HIS CONCERN THAT BOLIVIA WOULD BE DRAWN INTO A PERUVIAN/CHILEAN CONFLICT WHICH HE FEARS IS COMING SOON. HE NOTED THAT HE WAS NOT MAKING A “DENUNCIA” BUT WAS PRESENTING FACTS AS THEY NOW EXIST.\n\nGENERAL ROSSON SPOKE FOR HIMSELF AND ME, THANKING PRESIDENT BANZER FOR HIS CLEAR AND CONCISE STATEMENT OF BOLIVIA’S CONCERNS AND SAID THAT THEY WOULD BE TRANSMITTED TO WASHINGTON AS THE PRESIDENT HAD REQUESTED. THE CONVERSATION THEN CLOSED WITH EXPRESSIONS OF TRADITIONAL FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN THE U.S. AND BOLIVIA.\nCOMMENT AND CTION REQUESTED: PRESIDENT BANZER APPEARED SINCERELY TROUBLED ABOUT THE PERUVIAN/CHILEAN SITUATION. ACCORD-\n\nINGLY, I URGE THAT THE DEPARTMENT ARRANGE FOR THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE REVIEW OF PRESIDENT BANZER’S REQUEST AND, TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, OBTAIN AS POSITIVE A REPLY AS WE CAN MAKE TO HIM ABOUT MAINTENANCE OF BOLIVIA’S NEUTRALITY IN THE EVENT OF A PERUVIAN/CHILEAN CONFLICT. AS TO THE MINIMUM MILITARY CAPACITY, AN EXPRESSION OF COOPERATION AND FORTHCOMINGNESS RELATED TO THE MAP GRANT MATERIEL PROGRAM AND FUTURE FMS CREDIT LEVELS WOULD BE APPROPRIATE. A LETTER FROM PRESIDENT FORD ON THESE TWO POINTS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS A POSSIBLE VEHICLE FOR OUR REPLY. I ALSO NOTE THAT PRESIDENT BANZER’S REQUEST STRENGTHENS OUR PROPOSAL THAT THE POLICY PLANNING STAFF VISITS TO LATIN AMERICA INCLUDE BOLIVIA. IT SHOULD NOT BE OVERLOOKED THAT THE PRESIDENT BROADLY HINTED THAT HE WOULD LIKE AN INVITATION TO VISIT THE U.S. IF SUCH A VISIT COULD BE TIMED IN THE EARLY SPRING OF 1975, BEFORE THE BOLIVIAN ELECTIONS BUT AFTER BANZER HAS TAKEN HIMSELF OUT OF THE RACE, I BELIEVE IT WOULD HELP BANZER GUIDE BOLIVIA THROUGH THE CONSTITUTIONAL TRANSITION WITH LESS INSTABILITY–A MAJOR U.S. OBJECTIVE HERE. SEPARATE TELEGRAM WILL FOLLOW ELABORATING OUR VIEWS ON A POSSIBLE VISIT OF PRESIDENT BANZER TO WASHINGTON.\n\nDEPT PLEASE PASS DOD/OSD, DOD/JCS, USCINCSO, AND DOD/ISA.

THE BOLIVIAN AIR FORCE MAY DECIDE TO FOREGO THE PURCHASE OF FIGHTER AIRCRAFT FROM THE U.S. DURING THIS TIME FRAME, AS EVIDENCED BY THEIR LACK OF INTEREST IN THE RECENT OFFER OF THE A-37B; ALTHOUGH MAKING SUCH AIRCRAFT AVAILABLE ON A GRANT BASIS WOULD BE DIFFICULT FOR THE GOB TO RESIST.\nI NOW BELIEVE THAT WE COULD BEGIN EARLIER TO CHANGE OUR\n\n252007Z\nOPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE SUPPORT FROM A GRANT TO A CASH\nPROGRAM, THEREBY STIMULATING THE BOLIVIANS TO GREATER SELF-RELIANCE IN THIS AREA. WHILE I RECOMMEND APPROVAL OF THE SUGGESTED PLANNING LEVELS AT THIS TIME, I URGE THAT WE TAKE A HARD LOOK AT THE PROGRAM EACH YEAR TO SEE WHERE GRANT ASSISTANCE COULD BE REPLACED BY GOB PAYMENT FOR SERVICES OR CANCELLED.\n\nWHILE ITS ECONOMIC OUTLOOK IS IMPROVING FROM THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS STANDPOINT, BOLIVIA WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE POOREST COUNTRY IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE, EXCEPTING HAITI, AND WILL USE ITS EXTRA RESOURCES TO INVEST IN DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS. BOLIVIA, THEREFORE, SHOULD CONTINUE TO RECEIVE PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT IN THE ALLOCATION OF MAP-M, TO MINIMIZE THE EFFECT WHICH A DIVERSION OF GOB RESOURCES TO MILITARY PURCHASES WOULD HAVE ON THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE COUNTRY. SINCE THE PURCHASE OF C-130 OR OTHER APPROPRIATE TRANSPORT AIRCRAFT WILL BE A DEFINITE ASSIST TO BOLIVIA’S ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, I STRONGLY ENDORSE THE PURCHASE OF SUCH AIRCRAFT UNDER FMS CREDIT TERMS. BOLIVIA’S DEBT SERVICE RATIO FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS (1975-1977) MAY RISE TO RANGE AS HIGH AS 18 TO 20 PERCENT OF EXPORT EARNINGS, A MANAGEABLE BURDEN IN A GROWING ECONOMY. I REQUEST, THEREFORE, THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT FMS IS SUBSTITUTED FOR MAP IN BOLIVIA, IT BE DONE ON THE MOST CONCESSIONAL CREDIT TERMS.

I handed him Secretary Kissinger’s letter indicating that Secretary hoped by the letter to establish first personal contact with the Foreign Minister and to set the stage for the Mexico City meeting. The Foreign Minister was extremely pleased to receive a signed letter from the Secretary and since he does not understand English I had a chance to translate for him with brief explanations of points during the translation. I went over very carefully with the Foreign Minister our preferred format for the Mexico City meeting and followed with emphasis on several points which I thought were of importance to Bolivia. I sought particularly to enlist his support in the effort to encourage the more advanced Latin American countries to share their current high level of foreign exchange earnings with the less developed Latin countries through such institutions as the IDB and the Andean Development Corporation. I sought to underline the importance the Secretary attaches to this meeting while at the same time seeking to dispel any expectation that a miracle will be achieved in Mexico. I then sought to elicit from the Foreign Minister comments on Bolivia’s own position for the meeting, reactions to the points I had made, and any observations about what Bolivia might expect from the U.S. during the meeting.\nForeign Minister first of all asked me to convey to Washington authorities the great appreciation of the Bolivian government for the prompt and effective help provided through an airlift of 2 C-130 aircraft from the Canal Zone, bringing relief supplies for flood victims in Bolivia. He then went on to say that he felt that US/Bolivian relations were excellent and that Bolivia had nothing special that it wished to accomplish at the Mexico City meeting other than to participate constructively with us. He expressed pleasure that there was an indication of the joining of the Latin Americans and the US with the rest of the world and not just a hemispheric unity in isolation. He said Bolivia is concerned about its continued need for aid and certain old issues such as access to the sea, but that he did not feel these were appropriate for the high level meeting. As to the format, the Minister felt that it was most appropriate for us to work through the expert staff now working in Mexico City. Nonetheless, he expressed his view that all participants would accept Secretary Kissinger’s wishes as to the format because if the Secretary feels this is the most efficient way to proceed, the Latins should accept his opinion, given his demonstrable skill and successes in other international discussions. Foreign Minister agreed that there should not be a whole series of Latin American speakers nor should there be bilateral discussions with all Latin American countries. He said it was his opinion that three or four countries might speak for the entire hemisphere in the closed sessions.\nI received the strong impression that the Foreign Minister is relying heavily on his staff for guidance as to his conduct and the substance of his position in Mexico. This is probably in keeping with his experience as an army general and may also reflect that he is not very capable of dealing with foreign policy matters. It is important, therefore, that US representatives in Mexico establish contact with Bolivian Foreign Ministry staff if Bolivian understanding and cooperation is required during the conference. At this time in Mexico City Ambassador Fuentes Ibanez and Javier Murillo of the Foreign Ministry are doing basic work with the Mexican authorities. The Foreign Minister expects to arrive in Mexico City the morning of Feb. 15 accompanied by his principal Foreign Ministry assistant, Marcelo Ostria. I will meet with Ostria before his departure and report any impressions we receive from that conversation.\nIn conclusion we can expect no problems from the Bolivians and a high measure of support if we wish it.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1974LAPAZ00966\nDate: February 13, 1974\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 JAN 1960\nConcepts: MEETING AGENDA, ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE, LESS DEVELOPED COUNTRIES, FOREIGN MINISTERS MEETINGS, DIPLOMATIC"

The agreement, which dates from the Declaration of Quito, signed on August 11, 1979, establishes a 25-member Parliament which will meet for the first time on December 17, 1980, the 150th anniversary of the death of Simon Bolivar.\nFor ten years after the treaty enters onto force, the legislative body of each Andean Pact member country will select five Parliament representatives who will serve for a period of two years and who may be reelected. After the ten-year period, each country’s representatives will be chosen by universal suffrage. The Andean Parliament will elect a President and Vice President from among its members and will meet once a year with the location and time to be decided the previous year. Special sessions may be held when requested by one-third of the member countries.\nAccording to the agreement, the Parliament was created to reaffirm the principles of liberty, social justice and democracy, to assure a respect for human rights, and to help guarantee international peace and justice. The responsibilities of the Parliament include evaluating the integration process, cooperating with legislative bodies of member and non-member countries, and assisting member countries to implement the integration process.\nComment: According to the GOB Secretary of Integration, Fernando Gutierrez, the Andean Pact was “showing off” a bit by signing the Andean Parliament agreement at the same time the OAS annual meeting was being held in La Paz. Gutierrez feels that although the agreement expresses the region’s growing democratic convictions and embodies the Pact’s new political awareness, the Parliament will be a political body which may make recommendations only. End comment.\nFull text of agreement being pouched.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1979LAPAZ09336\nDate: November 01, 1979\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 jan 1960\nConcepts: TREATY RATIFICATION, COMMON MARKETS, ESTABLISHMENT OF OFFICES, CENTRAL LEGISLATURE"

In 1977 then President Banzer initiated a liberalization of virtually all major restrictions on human rights, releasing all reported political prisoners, allowing exiles to return, and scheduling elections for July 1978. This positive human rights momentum was not checked by the Pereda coup (August 1978) or the Padilla takeover (November 1978). While the first represented a brief interruption in the democratization process and the second was designed to put it back on track, both governments contributed to the improving human rights situation: General Pereda by abrogating the feared State Security Law, and General Padilla by overseeing in July 1979, possibly the most democratic elections in Bolivia’s history.\nAs none of the eight presidential hopefuls achieved the needed [majority] of the popular vote in the July 1979 elections, the issue went before the Congress where, similarly, none of the three leading candidates succeeded in obtaining [majority]. Finally, the Congress selected Senate President Walter Guevara Arze to serve as interim president with new elections scheduled for May 1980.\nGuevara’s interim government came to an abrupt end November 1, 1979, when a group of military officers and civilians under the leadership of Army Colonel Alberto Natusch Busch seized the government. The Natusch government responded to strong popular reaction against the coup and its interruption of the democratic process with the implementation of press censorship, a state of siege, and martial law. Protesting but unarmed civilians were confronted by undisciplined soldiers resulting in the death of approximately 200 persons, the wounding of some 200 others, and the unaccounted for disappearance of about 125 citizens, many of whom are now presumed dead. Popular discontent, a seven-day strike by the Confederation of Bolivian Workers (COB), and Natusch’s repressive measures hastened the demise of his regime.\nAfter Natusch’s resignation on November 16, an agreement was reached between the Congress, the COB, and the armed forces appointing Chamber of Deputies President Lidia Gueiler as interim president. President Guevara, who had become a resistance symbol in hiding during the Natusch regime, returned to his former Senate position. Ms. Gueiler is to be Bolivia’s interim president until the inauguration on August 6, 1980 of the winner of the 1980 elections, which will probably be held in June.\n\nRespect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:\nA. Torture\nThe Bolivian constitution prohibits torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment. The Padilla and Guevara administrations apparently respected this constitutional guarantee; there were no reports of torture during their brief governments – nor during the first weeks of President Gueiler’s administration. Allegations of torture during the short-lived Natusch regime remain unsubstantiated, but are currently being investigated by the Permanent Assembly on Human Rights (PAHR), Bolivia’s principal non-governmental organization promoting respect for human rights.\nThe Bolivian Congress also requested the PAHR on November 19 to document all cases of persons killed, wounded, or missing as a result of Natusch’s repressive measures. The findings are expected to be made public.\nB. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment\nNo reports of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment were received during the Padilla or Guevara governments nor during the first weeks of the Gueiler government. There are unsubstantiated allegations of beatings of political and labor leaders detained during the Natusch regime.\nAlthough the Bolivian constitution prohibits cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in all circumstances, PAHR representatives indicate that infractions occur. According to the PAHR, policemen sometimes beat persons accused of common crimes during interrogation to force confessions. Most such detainees do not file complaints, however, presumably either because they are unaware of their civil rights or because they fear reprisals. The PAHR believes that only a few police officials engage in such practices, and it is attempting to document cases of mistreatment so that offending policemen can be punished.\nMost prisons in Bolivia are old and overcrowded. Sanitary conditions are poor, and prisoners’ diet is inadequate. These conditions result in part from Bolivia’s low level of economic development and associated poverty. Many prisoners, however, receive supplementary money, food, clothing and medicines from relatives or friends. Others manufacture smalls for outside contractors in exchange for money or food to supplement prison fare. Prisoners have no opportunity to become rehabilitated through learning job skills or improving their education while in prison. Prison officials recognize the problems in the present system, but indicate that lack of adequate funding precludes early improvement.\nC. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment\nThe Padilla, Guevara, and Gueiler governments have not imprisoned persons for their political beliefs or activity. During the Natusch coup before press censorship was imposed, newspapers and the radio reported the arrest of several labor leaders and politicians in various parts of the country. These people were held only briefly. Additional reports of similar short-term detentions appeared in the press after censorship was lifted. There have also been reports that as many as 125 people disappeared during this two-week period, the majority of whom are unaccounted for. There were no known political prisoners in Bolivia at the end of November, 1979.\nPersons are frequently arrested and held for brief periods without charge in Bolivia. Occasionally, especially in serious criminal cases, a suspect is held longer than the 24 hours stipulated in the constitution before being brought before a judge. This is probably due more to procedural delays than any attempt by the police to deny justice. Habeas corpus exists and is respected in practice.\nD. Denial of Fair Public Trial\nPersons arrested in Bolivia are entitled by law to a fair public trial. However, the judicial process moves slowly, with some criminal cases taking years to complete because of inherent faults in the judicial system – antiquated procedures, shortage of qualified personnel, etc. Defendants may hire their own counsel, and may confer with them in private. Civil courts are independent of the military and civilians are not tried in military courts.\nE. Invasion of the Home\nThe sanctity of the home is constitutionally protected. There were no reports of invasions of the home during either the Padilla or Guevara governments nor were there during the first weeks of the Gueiler government. During the Natusch coup, however, illegal searches were made of the houses of some persons opposed to his takeover – mainly labor leaders and politicians – for weapons and for members of the Guevara “government in hiding”.\nGovernmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and Education:\nBolivia remains an underdeveloped country. Nevertheless, despite recurring serious macroeconomic problems, the government of Bolivia has succeeded in significantly improving the quality of life for the majority of its citizens. Since 1975, successive governments implemented a five-year Economic and Social Development Plan emphasizing a rapid growth, export-oriented strategy. The Plan’s original goals included improving national income distribution (an OAS study indicates that 5 percent of the Bolivian population controls 31 percent of the national income), incorporating the rural (mostly Indian) population into the modern life of the country, and improving overall welfare through education, health, and agricultural programs. While Bolivia’s worsening economic situation prevented the fulfillment of major elements of the plan, World Bank figures showed that by 1979 per capita GNP had reached $630 in 1977 dollars, up from $352 in 1960. The Gueiler government in its first weeks implemented an economic stabilization program, which, if well carried out, can provide the basis for resuming soundly-based long-term economic growth.\nAverage life expectancy is 52 years. The nationwide annual death rate is estimated at 18.5 per thousand and the infant mortality rate for children under one year of age in rural areas is 235 per thousand. These figures are partially the results of communicable, respiratory, and gastrointestinal diseases and malnutrition among the population. The health problems persist largely because of inadequate financing and direction to improve the quality and distribution of health services. Of the rural population, 11.2 percent lives in areas which have adequate sewage disposal; 12 percent have access to potable water.\nAn estimated 40 percent of the Bolivian population over the age of 15 is illiterate. In an effort to overcome this problem the government provides a free public education system through the university level. Unfortunately, rural poverty forces many children to neglect their studies in favor of working to help support their families. Also, school sessions are often interrupted by labor strife or political activity.\nThe lack of adequate housing is a serious problem. The majority of housing units in the major cities are substandard. Rural families typically live in adobe dwellings without basic sanitary facilities. The poor environmental conditions accompanying such housing exacerbate problems of sanitation, nutrition and other impediments to health.\nGovernment programs to fulfill basic human needs are hampered primarily by the lack of financial, human, and material resources. Although there have been occasional reports of corruption in the administration of some of these programs, it does not appear that corruption has been a major factor impeding their effective implementation.\nRespect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:\nA. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly\nUnder the Padilla and Guevara governments, there were no reports of violations of any of these freedoms which are constitutionally guaranteed. Soon after assuming power, Colonel Natusch, however, imposed press censorship, a state of siege, curfew, and martial law. After a crippling seven-day general strike called by the COB, Natusch agreed to lift these measures in exchange for an end to the strike. The National Press Association (ANP), and the Vice President of the Bolivian Ecumenical Conference, among others, protested the press censorship and the silencing of several radio stations during the two-week military takeover. Before the Natusch coup, the press in Bolivia exercised a degree of “self-censorship”, ostensibly to avoid political controversy that could jeopardize the democratization process.\nFreedom of speech, the press, and assembly were restored by the Gueiler government. There are no restrictions on religious freedom.\nB. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel and Emigration\nFreedom of movement, travel, and emigration is constitutionally protected although as a vestige of the MNR days of the 1950s Bolivians outside the country must apply at a Bolivian consulate for a visa to enter their own country. Only under the two-week Natusch regime were there any new restrictions on travel and these were eliminated when President Gueiler took office.\nC. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process\nPolitical parties and labor unions have been able to operate freely since early 1978. In July 1979, eight political parties or coalitions participated in the general elections; none was the official party. Despite some allegations of electoral fraud by the contending parties and coalitions, it is generally accepted that the Electoral Court did its job well and that actual fraud in these elections was minor. All citizens 21 years of age and older may vote.\nTraditionally, women have not enjoyed equal opportunity in Bolivia. However, this is changing. For example, before becoming interim president, Lidia Gueiler had been elected President of the Chamber of Deputies and awarded the Order of the Condor, Bolivia’s highest decoration, for her political activities. Two women presently serve in the Congress, and two in the cabinet. Indian women in both rural and urban areas continue to play a major role in the commercial sector and contribute substantially to family incomes.\nLabor unions exercise considerable power in Bolivian society, as evidenced by the general strike in early November, 1979 which contributed to the demise of the Natusch regime. Trade unions profess to maintain neutrality among political parties. Individual union members, however, often actively participate in partisan political activities.\nGovernment Attitude and Record Regarding International and Non-Governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights:\nThe Permanent Assembly on Human Rights (PAHR) is Bolivia’s principal non-governmental organization promoting respect for human rights. It maintains close contact with other international human rights organizations, whose members often travel to Bolivia for consultations on the state of human rights. The PAHR is working for the ratification of UN human rights agreements to which Bolivia is not yet a party.\nBolivia is the only Latin American country whose parliament has a human rights committee in each house. As part of its effort to improve human rights observance, Bolivia became a party to the American Convention on Human Rights in 1979.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1979STATE331361\nDate: December 26, 1979\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 jan 1960\nConcepts: HUMAN RIGHTS, REPORTS"

(Bolivia’s 1978 exports of tin were 29,696 MT’s worth approximately US$335.76 million.)\nHowever, based on an apparent moderate slowdown in tin production which is now being noted, we now project that this year’s exports will be closer to 28,500 MT’s. Again, the caveat cited in Para one applies to this estimate also. (If exports simply maintained the pace of the first trimester, exports would reach only about 26,000 MT’s. We believe, however, that this rate will pick-up somewhat.)\nIn spite of the projected fall in tin production, expected higher prices for Bolivia’s other metallic minerals exports (principally silver, tungsten, lead and zinc) are expected to provide Bolivia with total 1979 export earnings of approximately $527 million (CIF value), 3.1 percent higher than the total achieved last year.\nEmbassy’s projections have been shared informally with IMF officials in La Paz. Although the IMF’s own estimates of physical volumes closely parallel ours, the fund’s higher price for tin gives a more optimistic bottom line.\nPost’s latest projections in detail:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommodity\nVolume (MT’s)\nCIF Value (US$ Millions)\nFOB Value (US$ Millions)\n\n\n\n\nTin concentrates\n12,500\n159.83\n124.99\n\n\nTin metallic\n14,500\n187.00\n183.26\n\n\nTin alloys\n1,500\n19.18\n18.80\n\n\nAntimony concentrate\n7,900\n11.87\n8.08\n\n\nAntimony metallic\n2,600\n5.73\n5.27\n\n\nZinc\n55,000\n38.80\n6.40\n\n\nTungsten\n3,200\n41.69\n36.77\n\n\nCopper\n3,000\n5.29\n3.36\n\n\nLead\n18,000\n13.89\n9.72\n\n\nSilver\n200\n41.15\n27.12\n\n\nBismuth concentrate\n10\n0.04\n0.02\n\n\nBismuth metallic\n12\n0.05\n0.03\n\n\nCadmium\n50\n0.27\n0.04\n\n\nOthers\n–\n2.00\n1.50\n\n\nTOTAL\n\n526.79\n425.36\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1979LAPAZ04733\nDate: May 31, 1979\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 jan 1960\nConcepts: TIN, PRODUCTION, MINERALS, EXPORT DATA"

Banzer himself did much to stimulate this renewed upsurge of interest in the historic Bolivian obsession with “returning to the sea” by his optimistic appraisals of the outcome of his talks with Pinochet. Although the Banzer-Pinochet meeting coincided with the beginning of Bolivia’s annual “Week of the Sea” celebrations, most Bolivian political observers displayed a new willingness, in the wake of the talks, to put aside patriotic rhetoric in favor of a pragmatic search for possible grounds of agreement with its Pacific coast neighbors. At the same time, however, politicians and government officials alike realized the enormous difficulties facing Bolivia in its efforts to convince Chile and/or Peru to grant it renewed direct access to the sea. The major point upon which both the majority of political observers and the government of Bolivia itself appeared to be in agreement was the necessity for Bolivia to abstain from self-defeating threats of violence, much less actual recourse to physical force, in favor of peaceful, diplomatic initiatives toward resolving the country’s century-old landlocked status.\nThe principal theme of political discussion in Bolivia during March 1974 was the renewed prospect for movement on Bolivia’s desire for an access to the sea, opened up by the Banzer-Pinochet meeting in Brasilia at mid-month. Even before the two presidents held their widely-publicized “secret” meeting, political observers in La Paz were engaging in intensive speculation about the possibility that such an encounter could produce an improvement in Bolivian-Chilean relations. President Banzer himself lent credence to such speculation upon his return March 19 from the inauguration of President Geisel. According to press accounts, Banzer’s initial comments upon his interview with President Pinochet were as follows: Quote “President Pinochet has expressed to me his willingness to seek a solution to the fundamental problems (between Bolivia and Chile), considering that the fundamental problem of Bolivia is its maritime reintegration. He has demonstrated his good will, and let us hope that in a not too distant future we can take positive steps toward the solution of this problem.” Quote. Subsequently, in the face of Pinochet’s statement that the two presidents had agreed not to discuss Bolivia’s desire for a sea outlet, Banzer retreated to the position that he and Pinochet had quote “discussed the fundamental problems that have interrupted our relations (since 1962)” quote but that no specific discussion of possible solutions to Bolivia’s landlocked status had taken place.\nAlthough the Banzer-Pinochet meeting coincided with the beginning of Bolivia’s annual “Week of the Sea”, commemorating the loss of its seacoast to Chile in 1879, the tone of the president’s remarks appears to have influenced government officials and most political commentators to reduce traditional patriotic rhetoric in favor of a pragmatic search for possible grounds of agreement with Bolivia’s Pacific coast neighbors. Thus Jaime Ponce Caballero, secretary-general of the government’s Nationalist Popular Front, called upon public opinion to put aside “demagogic slogans” and support the president’s quest for improved relations with Chile. A considerable majority of Bolivian journalistic and political opinion also appeared to approve of the initial Banzer-Pinochet conversation, and expressed the hope that working-level talks could soon be initiated between the two countries.\nWhile discussion of the prospects for improved Bolivian-Chilean relations predominated in political circles, a number of observers also considered the problem of Bolivia’s desire for an outlet to the sea in the larger context of Bolivian-Chilean-Peruvian trilateral relations. Here an atmosphere of pessimism tended to prevail, despite spirited attempts by some commentators to raise the possibility of a summit conference of the three presidents, at which an accord might be reached to grant Bolivia a “corridor” to the sea. More typical of Bolivian views on the attitudes of its western neighbors was the comment of one politician that “Peru is willing to give us an outlet to the sea, through Antofagasta, and Chile will gladly grant us access to the sea through Tacna.”\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1974LAPAZ02024\nDate: April 02, 1974\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 JAN 1960\nConcepts: LANDLOCKED COUNTRIES, CHIEFS OF STATE MEETINGS, FOREIGN POLICY POSITION, ACCESS TO PORTS"

MANSBACH INDICATED OPIC LAWYERS WERE CONSIDERING SOMEHOW SEPARATING OPIC INSURANCE CONTRACTS AND THE NECESSARY FGA’S FROM THEPROVISIONS OF ART. 51, YET PRESER- VING SUBROGATION RIGHTS UNDER THE BILATERAL AGREEMENTS. THIS MIGHT BE BASED ON INTERPRETING ART. 51 TO REFER ONLY TO GOVERNMENT “INSTRUMENTS RELATING TO INVESTMENT” WHILE MAINTAINING THAT OPIC INVESTMENT INSURANCE CONTRACTS ARE NOT OR WILL NOT BE GOVERNMENT INSTRUMENTS.MANSBACH SAID THAT OPIC MIGHT HIRE A LOCAL LAWYER TO LOOK INTO SUCH POSSIBILITIES. WE BELIEVE THAT OPIC CANNOT HAVE IT BOTH WAYS. IF IT IS A PRIVATE INSURANCE COMPANY, THEN ITS RIGHTS SHOULD NOT BE SUBROGATED TO USG, EXCEPT PERHAPS BY THE PROCESSES OF STATE DEPT. ESPOUSAL OF PRIVATE CLAIMS. WE DOUBT,\n\n062118Z\nHOWEVER, THAT THE ANDEAN PACT COMMISSION OR GOB WILL AGREE THAT\nART. 51 REFERS ONLY TO GOVERNMENT INVESTMENT INSTRUMENTS IF THEY ARE AWARE THAT THE “PRIVATE” INSURER INTENDS TO AVAIL ITSELF OF THE BENEFITS OF A GOVERNMENT TO GOVERNMENT BILATERAL TREATY.\n\nMANSBACH INDICATED THAT OPIC PLANS TO INSURE LOAN OR LOANS TO NEW JERSEY ZINC (NJZ), A SUBSIDIARY OF GULF AND WESTERN, PERHAPS SUPPLEMENTED BY A DIRECT OPIC LOAN AND DIRECT INVESTMENT INSURANCE IN CONCERT WITH A JAPANESE INVESTMENT IN THE MIXED COMPANY NJZ SEEKS TO FORM. WE RECALLED THAT IN LA PAZ 2284 WE WARNED THAT THE EMBASSY MIGHT RECOMMEND AGAINST INSURANCE FOR NJZ. WE STATD USG SHOULD HAVE BIAS AGAINST INSURING INVESTMENTS IN SENSITIVE MINING SECTOR AND THAT WE DID NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT INFO ON NJZ PLANS TO PROPERLY EVALUATE SITUATION. IT APPEARED TO US THAT NJZ HAD MADE ITS MOVES TO BUY GIBRALTAR HUARI-HUARI BEFORE IT COULD HAVE BEEN ASSURRED OF HAVING OPIC INSURANCE, ESPECIALLY IN VIEW OF THE PARA- GRAPH OPIC PUT IN ITS REGISTRATION NOTICE OF APRIL 2, 1974 WHICH PLACES NJZ PROJECT UNDER “LARGE AND SENSITIVE POLICY GUIDELINES” AND WARNS NJZ THAT ISSUES SHOULD BE DISCUSSED WITH OPIC AND RESOLVED BEFORE IT PROCEEDS TO INVEST OR COMMIT THE PREDOMINANT PART OF ITS PROPOSED INVESTMENT. WE REPORTED IN LA PAZ 1972 THAT NJZ HAD PAID IMPC/GIBRALTAR HUARI-HUARI DEBTS TO BANCO MINERO TOTALLING US$ 240,000 BEFORE MARCH 28, 1974. IT APPEARS THAT NJZ’S INTEREST WAS SO GREAT THAT IT MADE THIS PAYMENT ON OR BEFORE THE DATE OF ITS REQUEST FOR OPIC INSURANCE. REPORTEDLY NJZ ALREADY HAS INVESTED AT LEAST US$ 1.4 MILLION AND PERHAPS AS MUCH AS US$ 4.4 MILLION IN ITS GIBRALTAR HUARI-HUARI PROJECT. IT SEEMS LIKELY, THEREF ORE, THAT OPIC INSURANCE IS NOT ESSENTIAL TO NJZ DECISION TO GO AHEAD WITH THIS PROJECT.\nIN RESPONSE TO THESE VIEWS, MANSBACH SAID “ADDITONALITY” NOT ALWAYS ESSENTIAL AND THAT OPIC NEEDS TO SPREAD ITS RISKS IN SOME CASES TO SOUND INVESTMENTS THAT MAY NOT BE “ADDITIONAL” DUE TO THE OPIC INSURANCE INCENTIVE. WE BELIEVE THAT BOLIVIAN MINING SECTOR IS ONE OF LAST PLACES OPIC SHOULD LOOK FOR DIVERSIFYING INTO SOUND INVESTMENTS. WE SUSPECT NJZ INVESTMENT WILL BE ECONOMICALLY SOUND, BUT POLITICALLY RISKY.\nGULF AND WESTERN ALSO OWNS, THROUGH ITS SUBSIDIARY BROWN & CO., KELLGUANI MINE. TOGETHER WITH GIBALTAR HUARI-HUARI, GULF AND\n\n062118Z\nWESTERN COULD RAPIDLY BECOME BIGGEST AND MOST VISIBLE PRIVATE MINING INTEREST IN BOLIVIA.\n\nMINOR POINT IS THAT IMPC/GIBRALTAR HUARI-HUARI HAS ALREADY INVESTED US$ 1.2 MILLION ORE MORE. OPIC WOULD HAVE TO BE QUITE CLEAR ON EXACLY WHAT IT WOULD BE COVERING.\nGIVEN ALL THESE CONSIDERATIONS, WE BELIEVE IT IS IN USG\n\nINTEREST TO OPPOSE OPIC INSURANCE FOR NJZ, AT LEAST UNTIL DETAILED INFORMATION MADE AVAILABLE TO EMBASSY. CAREFUL DECISION CAN THEN BE MADE ON BASIS SUCH INFORMATION.\n\nMATTER OF INVESTMENTS IN AGRICULTURAL LAND WAS RAISED BY STATE 185136 DURING MANSBACH’S VISIT. AS EMBASSY HAD NOT RECEIVED RESPONSE TO EARLIER MESSAGES ON STOKES APPLICATION (AS WELL AS TO SOME OTHER APPLICATIONS), WE SENT LA PAZ 5513 OPPOSING INSURANCE FOR STOKES AT LEAST UNTIL ISSUES RESOLVED. EMBASSY CONSIDERS AGRICULTURAL LAND TO BE SECTOR AS SENSITIVE AS MINING IN VIEW LONG STANDING AGRARIAN REFORM POLICIES AND UNRESOLVED LAND INVESTMENT DISPUTE (APPLEGATE/ YOUNGUIST CASE). WHILE THIS GOVERNMENT HAS DONE NOTHING TO EXTEND REACH OF AGRARIAN REFORM, IT HAS ALLOWED COFADENA (MILITARY CORPORA- TION) TO TAKE OVER CAMPO LUMINOSA, ONE OF BOLIVIA’S LARGEST CATTLE RANCHES WHICH HAD OVERDUE DEBTS WITH BANCO DEL ESTADO. AS POPULATION PRESSURE MOUNTS IN SANTA CRUZ, CHAPARE BENI AND NORTHERN LA PAZ, WE EXPECT FURTHER EXTENSION AGRARIAN REFORM WILL BECOME BURNING POLITI- CAL ISSUE WHICH ALMOST ANY PROSPECTIVE GOVERNMENT LIKELY TO RESOLVE TO SOME EXTENT IN FAVOR OF BOLIVIAN SMALL FARMER AT EXPENSE OF LARGE FOREIGN FARMER. MOREOVER, AS WE HAVE NOTED PREVIOUSLY, LAND TITLE EVEN AMONG LARGE DEVELOPERS APPARENTLY MATTER OF CONTINUAL DISPUTE. MANSBACH ASKED EMBASSY TO CONSIDER MATTER CAREFULLY TO DECIDE WHETHER WE WISHED RAISE OBJECTIONS TO INVESTMENTS IN AGRICULTURAL LAND ON POLITICAL GROUNDS.\nAFTER CONSIDERATION OF OPIC POSITIONS IN GENERAL ON SIGNIFICIANCE OF REGISTRATION NOTES, SUBROGATION AND INVOLVEMENT OF OTHER USG PROGRAMS IN EFFORTS ARRANGE PAYMENTS TO OPIC INSURED FIRMS IN NATIONALIZA- TION CASES, AS WELL AS RECENT EXPERIENCE WITH HANDLING APPLICATIONS COVERING MINING AND AGRICULTURAL LAND INVESTMENTS, WE CONFIRM OUR EARLIER POSITION THAT THERE SHOULD BE A STRONG BIAS AGAINST INSURING SUCH INVESTMENTS IN BOLIVIA, BUT WE STILL DO NOT WISH TO CLOSE THE\n\n062118Z\nDOOR COMPLETELY. AS MAJORITY OF “BOLIVIAN” APPLICATION TO OPIC APPEAR TO BE TWO MOST SENSITIVE AREAS AND AS OPIC PROCEDURES NOW RESULT IN ALMOST IMMEDIAT AND AUTOMATIC ISSUANCE OF REGISTRA- TION NOTICE AND AS OPIC BENDS EVERY EFFORT TO GRANT INSURANCE ONCE REGISTRATION NOTICE ISSUED, WE BELIEVE BEST PROCEDURE TO MEET OUR POLITICAL AND PROGRAM CONCERNS IN SENSITIVE AREAS, DEFINED AS MINING AND AGRICULTURAL LAND, WOULD BE ALONG FOLLOWING LINES: 1) OPIC WOULD ADVISE APPLICANT THAT REGISTRATION NOTICE CANNOT BE ISSUED UNTIL DETAILED INVESTMENT PROPOSAL PRESENTED TO OPIC AND OPIC CAN CONSULT WITHIN USG: 2) EMBASSY SHOULD BE PROVIDED WITH THESE DETAILS AND ALLOWED TO MAKE RECOMMENDATION BEFORE REGISTRA- TION NOTICE ISSUED: 3) IF INVESTOR ALTERS APROJECT, EMBASSY SHOULD BE ADVISED SO RECOMMENDATION CAN BE REVIEWED.\n10.EMBASSY FULLY REALIZES THAT OPIC CAN DEAL WITH MANY PROBLEMS\nBY CAREFUL DRAFTING INSURANCE CONTRACT, BUT SUCH ADJUSTMENT MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT IN SOME CASES. WE BELIEVE BEST INTERESTS USG WILL BE SERVED BY GIVING MOST CAREFUL, CAUTIOUS AND BROAD CONSIDER- ATION TO INSURING U.S. INVESTMENTS IN SENSITIVE AREAS RATHER THAN EMPHASIZING OVERCOMING (PERHAPS ONLY SUPERFICIALLY) ANY OBSTACLES THAT APPEAR AND OBJECTIONS THAT MIGHT BE RAISED.

END SUMMARY.\n        \n            \n    \n    \n  \n\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE TELEGRAM\nUNCLASSIFIED\n\n“Mr. Minister:”In my position as representative of International Metal Processing Corporation, I have remained in the country two weeks trying to contact you, Mr. Minister, and with other authorities, to discuss the problem that has arisen with Embosa and try to reach an arbitrated agreement as provided in Article 39 of the social statutes of the cited enterprise. “Unfortunately, I have not had the opportunity sought for, surely due to the extremely heavy workload of all the persons whom I have tried to contact.”In the face of this negative result, we, the stockholders of International Metal Processing Corporation, think that the present situation is the same as that of January, 1971, the date when the enterprise was nationalized by the government headed by General Juan Jose Torres. Consequently our present position is one of repeating our request to the Supreme Government of Bolivia for the payment of adequate and just indemnization which we solicit along with accumulated interest because of the non-performance of the Mining Corporation of Bolivia. “The situation resolved in this leval, just and equitable manner, International Metal Processing Corporation would have the right and freedom to recuperate the process patent and to utilize it in the manner most convenient to its interests.”I express to you in advance, Mr. Minister, that the liquidation of the Bolivian Metallurgical Enterprise, S.A. (mixed) has not arisen for the reasons indicated in Article 39 of the statutes, as I am able to demonstrate that financing could not be obtained, due precisely to the lack of a series of requirements that are not imputable to IMPC. “I very respectfully ask you, Mr. Minister, to consider carefully the historical facts presented in very summary form and to channel them adequately within the juridical order presently extant in the country so that they reach a satisfactory solution which contemplates the interests of both sides.”With this purpose I repeat to you assurance of my highest and distinguished consideration. “International Metal Processing Corporation”Frank M. Tye, Jr. President”.\nComment: Due continued absence Minattache and careful review our files, following comment should be regarded as preliminary and tentative. During Tye’s earlier visit to La Paz he showed to Emboffs decided lack of interest in pressing his claim through arbitration clause as provided in statutes. Difficult accept proposition that liquidation Embosa returns situation to January, 1971 situation as we understand Tye accepted check for US$ 1.4 million in December, 1971. Statutes state patent to be property of Comibol after one year of use. End Comment.\nWe understand Tye in La Paz (as indicated Reftel) accompanied by “two foreigners”, probably Americans. He has not called on Embassy.

De ahí la importancia que tiene que reconocerse a las buenas relaciones entre Estados Unidos y América Latina y la necesidad que hay de eliminar aquellas condiciones que llevan a malos entendidos.”Un paso notable se ha dado recientemente, cuando Estados Unidos y Panamá suscribieron un documento en el cual se sientan las bases para llegar posteriormente a un tratado que substituya al de 1903, todavía vigente, y que, por las injusticias que contiene es fuente de continuos roces… En los últimos veinticinco años, Estados Unidos fue impulsor de la independencia de muchas naciones coloniales y, por lo tanto, no podía negarse a seguir la misma ruta en lo que toca a relaciones similares, si no iguales, que mantiene con algunos territorios. Que la nueva mentalidad se abre camino es comprobado por varios hechos, como la finalización de la guerra de Vietnam, varias declaraciones oficiales de los últimos años y la actitud ante las justas reclamaciones panameñas”.\nLuego de afirmar que el caso de Panamá tenía que ser resuelto por varias razones y mostrar su creencia de que también el caso de Guantánamo será resuelto cuando mejoren las relaciones entre Estados Unidos y Cuba, el editorial de “Presencia” finaliza diciendo: “Si los principios ahora acordados llegan a concretarse en un tratado, como esperamos que suceda, todos habremos ganado, inclusive Estados Unidos, que podrá integrar en mejores condiciones la Comunidad Americana y eliminar una fuente de incomprensiones. Así lo han de ver quienes, en la potencia norteña, no tengan vista de corto alcance y adviertan lo mucho que podemos hacer todos en una acción mancomunada. Y sostenida en la igualdad y la amistad.”\nFrench acting\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1974LAPAZ00907\nDate: February 11, 1974\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 JAN 1960\nConcepts: FOREIGN RELATIONS, PRESS COMMENTS, PANAMA CANAL TREATY, NEGOTIATIONS, MAGAZINES"

Embassy believes postponement may be one month.\nMinmines insists that Sapi end delaying tactics and not try to bargain reversion of concession issue with settlement of old tax problems not yet settled by Ministry which now matter for Controller General as well. He acknowledged Sapi right in some of old tax problems but wrong in others.\nDespite position on tax matter as reported Para 2, Minmines stated three separate issues are involved and wants three issues settled in package deal. Issues are (A) unresolved tax matters pending for over ten years, (B) reversion of 12,000 hectares of concessions which Minister thought Sapi would never mine, and (C) future of Sapi in Bolivia involving Sapi’s plans to participate in joint venture operation with Bolivian private capital to work on part of old Bolinca concession.\nMinister asked for guarantee of USG that these three matters would be resolved and that Sapi would end delaying tactics. Emboffs replied that to our knowledge Sapi had tried to resolve problem at least as early as October, 1973 and that USG could not offer guarantees but that Mission would use its best offices toward finding rapid solution.\nAsked whether O’Neill’s presence in Bolivia required, Minister said not necessary until package deal is ready to sign.\nFYI. Minmines blamed most of ill will between Sapi and Gob on Sapi’s lawyer, Rene Rojas, who always waited to very end before trying to settle issue. End FYI. Remarked Sapi contract very bad one for Bolivia. Stated for 15 years Sapi only worked 700 hectares and Gob unwilling to wait for another ten years to get land back which Sapi had indicated it does not intend to work.\nMinmines stated old tax question had been referred to Bolivia’s Internal Revenue Department (Direccion Nacional de la Renta, DNR), and to Controller General. Said commission formed by Ministry of Mines to look into tax question, mostly involving taxes paid on redredging of tailings, will visit Sapi’s old working sites and would be accompanied by representatives of Controller General, DNR, and Banco Minero. Minister added that under Bolivian law tax claims could not be a matter of negotiation and compromise as is often the case in the U.S. He said this especially true at present due to intensive “moralization campaign” being conducted by Minister of State Curruto which bringing out number of old unresolved tax issues.\nComment: Minmines seemed disposed to grant new gold mining concession to Echazu Group which would have connection with Sapi, but it was obvious that Minister prefers concession to be in national hands.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1974LAPAZ00548\nDate: January 25, 1974\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 JAN 1960\nConcepts: TIN, LAND, MEETINGS, MINING INDUSTRY, JOINT VENTURES, NEGOTIATIONS, TAXES"

Summary\nSome will say that the ghastly orgy of the Bolivian Right in the last 5 days was an inevitable, cathartic phase of Bolivia’s difficult course to civilian democracy. I had hoped it was not and still feel it could have been avoided if the civilian parties, backed by the decent–and then dominant–sector of the military, had come to a coalition agreement with President Walter Guevara even 48 hours earlier. Whether an unavoidable relapse set in or a very near rescue operation fell short by a hair, the scars of the bloody November eruption are clear and will be long lasting. End Summary.\n\n\n2. The Radical Right has had its Witches’ Sabbath\nIn the upside-down world of its own nightmares. For 5 days black has been white, repression has been deliverance, unarmed workers and innocent bystanders have been Trotskyite terrorists and phantom Cuban cadres. And the frightened recruits egged on by the officers of the paranoic Right really showed them. The phantoms were mowed down by the dozens to save Bolivia from the anarchy and chaos of the “tyrant” Walter Guevara–a quiet, fatherly intellectual who in fact presided over a peaceful and open Bolivian society in which no one was hurt and most people felt good about Bolivia again.\nBut the Right knew better, only they–the totem, self appointed savior Alberto Natusch, the psychotic Carlos Mena (Interior Minister) and the frustrated knights without dragons like Doria Medina (Commander of the spearhead armoured unit)–could see the real demons that hid beneath this placid surface.\n\n\n3. The Warning from Military Leaders\nThe good men who led the Bolivian Armed Forces until November 1, Generals David Padilla and Ramon Azero in particular, told these glassy eyed zealots that they were wrong and that the real Bolivia was otherwise. We did as well, repeatedly over the last 6 months. They were told again, within days of the November 1 coup that:\n\nThe Bolivian people wanted civilian democracy and would not stand idly by while some colonels told them they could not have it;\nThe labor unions would try to shut this country down before acquiescing in a military takeover;\nOnly repression could keep one of these colonels on top of an unwilling country;\nIn the futile effort to sustain such a repressive regime the unity and reputation of the Bolivian Armed Forces would be destroyed and Bolivia’s international image stained;\nIn the end the decent military would not stomach the necessary amount of repression.\n\nMost of these consequences have already been incurred while the last remains perilously suspended. But somehow the true believers would not take it from us nor their own commanders.\n\n\n4. Civilian Casualties and Resistance\nMost of the deaths in the last 5 days, to our knowledge, have been unarmed civilians gunned down by the military with automatic weapons. Yet the civilians have come back each day to mark their protest and hurl their ire. Threats of shooting and summary firing have not got them back to their jobs. Neither destruction by gun fire and sacking of the labor confederation headquarters nor deadly fire into crowds of militants gathered before it have broken the general strike. So far the Natusch regime’s appallingly indiscriminate firing at civilians has had the opposite of the intended effect. Resistance of the militants has been steeled and the most common people are afraid to enter the inner city to take up their jobs.\n\n\n5. Negotiations\nNegotiations between Natusch and the Congress continue. But in the end no compromise between civilian democracy and the military right of Natusch is possible: they are incompatible forces. The fanatics around Natusch, particularly Mena, keep telling him he must hang on or perish, and they are right. If Natusch accepts a graceful out of almost any kind, he and his sort, given the killing they have caused, will be swept by a counteraction out of the country if not out of this world. There may, therefore, be no graceful out for Natusch and his right-wing band of officers. If he is deposed, it is more likely to come from within the military than from negotiations with the Congress. There remains the fear that these negotiations are not in good faith and are only part of Natusch’s efforts to hold off military pressures to unseat him. Yet so far the focal point for a military counter move has not appeared.\n\n\n6. Reaction of “Good Officers”\nThe good officers are appalled and in tears of mixed rage and sorrow over the killing of civilians and degradation of the military as a political and social force in Bolivia. Generals Padilla and Azero, Colonel Caioja and others have lost their jobs and staked their lives over bold public calls to get the military out of the city, Natusch out of the palace and civilian democracy restored. But the bulk of the military is still watching and waiting.\n\n\n7. Damage Assessment\nWhether Natusch and his band leave tomorrow, next month or later, some awesome damage has already been done to Bolivia and its tortuous, but determined course to civilian, constitutional rule.\n\nThe fabric of military-civilian cooperation, so important to the democratic transition so far, has been rent by betrayal, blood and bitterness;\nThe fragile unity of the armed forces has been shattered by schisms of deep resentment and shame–and dissension in the armed forces has been the only serious threat to the peace that modern Bolivia has known;\nThe military has been disgraced and its ability to play a stabilizing, behind the scenes role damaged and perhaps destroyed;\nThe credibility in the eyes of the people of the moderate, civilian political parties has been shaken by the despicable instigating role in the coup of a handful of turncoats from the MNR and MNRI–Guillermo Bedregal, Jose Fellman Velarde, Edel Sandoval Moron and Abel Ayoroa Argandona.\n\n\n\n8. Conclusion\nThe possible positive effects in the hangover from the Walpurgisnacht of the Right are meager or nil. Just perhaps the arrogant, paranoic right of the military will be purged after the bloody binge on which they have misled their institution, perhaps civilian politics will throw out or indict the quislings who viewed a bloodbath as a small price for a government job. But neither one may happen and both together would not justify perhaps 100 dead and many more wounded, nor the lasting damage to an open society and Bolivians confidence in each other or themselves.\nBOEKER\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1979LAPAZ09512\nDate: 06 Nov 1979\nClassification: Confidential (EXDIS)\nDeclassified: 20 Mar 2014 (E.O.

The Bolivian economy is based on tin, as Bolivia is the world’s second largest producer of tin. Therefore, the selling of stockpiles of tin by the U.S. is perceived by Bolivians as being anti-Bolivian. The potential exists for demonstrations and rallies to occur during the stay of the Secretary to express their displeasure with the congressional procedure. Intelligence information from Embassy intelligence sources along with information obtained from GOB police officials does not indicate any projected violence to the Secretary of State or OAS members. The tin issue is a very volatile situation in Bolivia; however, the OAS conference is widely viewed by Bolivians as contributing to their international prestige and enhancing their reputation. For these reasons, neither the left nor right-wing parties desire any type of action that would cause disgrace or harm to Bolivian pride and national goals. In summary, while the tin issue remains antagonistic, there appears to be negative information directly related against the Secretary of State, and no hard intelligence to warrant any assassination attempts.\n\nBoeker\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1979LAPAZ08837\nDate: October 17, 1979\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 jan 1960\nConcepts: INTELLIGENCE ASSESSMENTS, MINISTERIAL VISITS, ANTIDUMPING LAW (TRADE)"

The program includes the following:\n\nA devaluation of 25 percent to 24.51 pesos (buying) 25 pesos (selling) to the dollar.\nA graduated wage bonus for private and public sector employees earning less than 9,000 pesos per month.\nIncreases in hydrocarbon prices and the cost of public transportation.\nA 1980 consolidated public sector budget equivalent to the 1979 levels plus the cost of the wage increase. Some small increases would be permitted for the ministries of Defense, Health, Education, and the Interior.\nCreation of a Council of Monetary Stabilization (Consejo Nacional de Politica Monetaria) to monitor the program.\nMonetary measures include increases in time and demand deposit interest rates, changes in the legal reserve requirements, a prior import deposit of 100 percent replacing the previous 500 percent deposit, and a new tax on commercial bank credit for both peso and dollar loans. Bankers have been in meetings with the Central Bank most of the day finding out what the new measures mean to them. For this reason, commercial banks are not carrying out foreign exchange transactions today. Money exchange houses are open and are buying dollars at the official rate and selling them at near 25 pesos to the dollar but, according to one exchange house manager, there are no dollars to sell.\nPrice controls on flour, some pasta products, rice, sugar, bread, and rent controls on all housing.\n\nWe anticipate some popular reaction, since the Bolivian Labor Federation, which caused the measures to be postponed, apparently was not included in the government’s decision to go ahead with the measures. Nevertheless, we anticipate that after some show of protest, Juan Lechin and his COB will go along.\nAccording to local IMF representative Jorge Sol Perez, the GOB’s economic measures include the basic program outlined in reftel. The Central Bank is authorized to make daily exchange rate adjustments and plans to do so until the rate reaches an equilibrium. The price hike for petroleum products will average 136 percent. Sol Perez said that an IMF mission will arrive over the coming weekend; he expects a letter of intent to be prepared and ready for signature by late next week.\nAfter the early morning announcement of the economic measures, Bolivia’s major cities remain calm and business is normal. This morning a student demonstration rumored to be against the measures turned out to be students gathering at one of La Paz’ main plazas for the final leg of an early morning marathon. Minister of Finance Augusto Cuadros Sanchez told the ambassador that so far public reaction to the measures had been calm and philosophical, that in a sense the measures turned out less severe than the public had anticipated. Cuadros was sanguine the stabilization program would now go forward without the threat of a major strike by the labor sector.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1979LAPAZ10309\nDate: November 30, 1979\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 jan 1960\nConcepts: ECONOMIC CONTROLS, DEVALUATIONS, CURRENCIES"

Llano is key Bolivian population export and will be most infuelential in formulating GOB position.\nUSAID is reviewing talking points with probable Bolivian delegation (BOLDEL), especially with Llano. BOLDEL likely to adopt position that does not RPT not seek to set targets for reducing birth rates as in U.S. position. They are also likely not to support Argentine/Brazilian pro-natalist position although they have already received cables from Brazilians seeking support. Rather, Bolivian position will stress need for “Responsible Parenthood” programs to improve maternal child health, by providing family planning services with the additional objective of reducing abortions in Bolivia.\nMission understands UN will provide travel/per diem for Paz and GOB will finance Rivero travel directly. USAID will authorize CENAFA use its funds (provided by mission to project) for Llano trip.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1974LAPAZ02176\nDate: April 08, 1974\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 JAN 1960\nConcepts: POPULATION, MEETING AGENDA, MEETINGS, MEETING DELEGATIONS"

The garrisons asked for six days to give their response in writing, but Pereda was still hoping that all needed approvals could be obtained in time for an August 6 announcement of new elections. Natush said Carlos Iturralde (GOB ambassador in Washington) had been sent to see Banzer in Santa Cruz to solicit a nod of approval from him to Banzer loyalists in the military on the election plan. Natush thought that if Banzer would cooperate this would assure success but he was optimistic in any case. Pereda, he said was meeting his commitments to US.\nThis morning Edwin Tapia called me to say that Pereda’s meetings with garrisons in La Paz, Cochabamba, and Santa Cruz had gone well and it looked good for approval of elections in late 1979 or very early 1980. He too was optimistic that Pereda could make his speech on August 6 or, at the latest, one or two days later. Tapia asked whether we could now proceed with affirmation of continuing US-Bolivian relations. I told him I would see what I could do.\nComment. Nothing in Bolivia is ever certain until it happens. But it is clear that Pereda is making progress, that he is now on the right side of the election issue, and a little boost to him now would probably help both our objectives–new elections and maintenance of peace and, ergo, the human rights environment in Bolivia. Therefore, I recommend we now acknowledge receipt of the Foreign Minister’s note and that I be authorized subsequently to request an appointment with the Foreign Minister to discuss on-going business, such as the prisoner exchange treaty.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1978LAPAZ06188\nDate: August 03, 1978\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 jan 1960\nConcepts: GOVERNMENT REFORM, REPORTS, NATIONAL ELECTIONS, CAT-B"

Russian, German, Japanese, Brazilian, French, Polish and Czechoslovak offers reportedly also likely to be made.\nComment: According to Singmaster and Bryer (consultants to U.S. Steel and COMIBOL) report of 1969, there is no technical reason why an electrolytic zinc plant could not be installed and operated successfully in Bolivia despite problems of high altitude. However, report also stated that economic success of the zinc refinery depended on electric power costs, sufficient reserves for guaranteed delivery of zinc concentrates for 20 years, and guaranteed market for sulphuric acid produced, which due to high transportation costs, would have to be marketed internally. For zinc refinery with annual output of 33,600 metric tons of zinc, 265,440 pounds of cadmium, and 360 tons of copper residues, 61,000 metric tons of sulphuric acid would be produced. Embassy believes that whether present economics of smelter are justifiable or not, smelter will be built in any event.\nAction requested: USDOC is requested to encourage potentially interested U.S. firms to communicate directly with Minister of Mining and Metallurgy, Raul Lema Patino, Ministero de Mineria y Metalurgia, 1769 Avenida 16 de Julio, La Paz, Bolivia and copy to Empresa Nacional de Fundiciones (ENAF), Casilla 4298 La Paz Bolivia. ENAF’s cable address is “ENAFBOL”, La Paz: its telex numbers are BX5271 and ITT 3560090.\nThe tender will be reported to USDOC when issued.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1974LAPAZ00742\nDate: February 04, 1974\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 JAN 1960\nConcepts: ZINC, CONSTRUCTION, MINING INDUSTRY"

FOR THIS, WE ARE USING OUR SACRIFICE, DISCIPLINE AND WORK IN ORDER TO EST ABLISH THE BASES WHICH WILL MAKE POSSIBLE A SUSTAINED RHYTHM OF SHARED PROGRESS AND WELFARE.\nTHE BASIC OBJECTIVE OF MY GOVERNMENT IS THAT OF DEVELOPMENT. THE PEOPLE OF THIS WORTHY LAND ARE ENTITLED TO WORK, THINK, AND BELIEVE WITH NO OTHER LIMITATION THAN THAT OF THEIR OWN POSSIBLITIES.

(Together these three entities represent slightly more than a third of Comibol production.) Additionally, the remainder of Comibol’s mines are on quasi-strike, i.e., there is little production.\nObviously, the final effect of the current political crisis on Bolivia’s 1979 tin output depends on how long the strikes/slowdowns persist. However, even prior to the November 1 coup, 1979 tin production was lagging slightly more than five percent behind 1978’s 30,880 metric tons. The effect of production lost just since November 1 now requires a revised estimate that 1979’s shortfall over 1978 will be at least ten percent. If stoppages continue (and spread to the private mines) and there is little further production through the end of the year, the 1979 total could be as low as 24,500 metric tons.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1979LAPAZ09817\nDate: November 14, 1979\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 jan 1960\nConcepts: TIN, ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, MINING INDUSTRY, LABOR STRIKES"

If the government cannot obtain substantial financial credits (i.e., in the vicinity of $100 million) before elections, a substantial buildup of arrearages on foreign obligations by the end of July is virtually a foregone conclusion.\nAccording to a reliable source who spoke with Minister Alba the evening of May 9, Alba told the cabinet meeting that morning that the country “had reached an historic landmark: reserves (i.e., the international reserves of the consolidated banking system) had fallen to zero.” According to source, Alba also tried to press for action on hydrocarbons, referring to an earlier cabinet agreement in principle on the subject, but found that whatever accord may have existed had evaporated. At the same meeting, Minister of Energy and Hydrocarbons Candia is said to have informed the cabinet that YPFB (the government-owned petroleum company) will not have sufficient funds to meet its June payroll.\nIn line with the gloomy economic news given the cabinet, the President of the Central Bank informed us that in the absence of new financial credits he doubted the government could continue to meet its financial obligations beyond June 15. He added that he had received offers of up to $150 million in financing, but that they were contingent upon the adoption of an economic stabilization program. In the absence of such a program he doubts that even short-term financing can be obtained, and he (a career banker) claims to have taken the position within the government that he will not lend his reputation to a search for credits unless, at a minimum, meaningful price increases in hydrocarbons are instituted.\nPresident Padilla’s reaction to this pressure has been to fire both Finance Minister Alba and probably Central Bank President Fabri as well. He has replaced Alba with a loyal military man whose job will be to stop talking about economic reforms and start looking for enough borrowed money to finance reserve losses and essential domestic expenses, in particular government salaries, until the August transition. This will be Padilla’s last word on economic measures unless financial collapse forces action.\nLt. Colonel Javier Alcoreza, whom President Padilla named Minister of Finance May 11, although regarded as an able and intelligent officer, has no known experience in economics or finance, and is a relative stranger to domestic and international bankers. He is a close associate of President Padilla and has most recently been occupied with negotiating the bulk of Bolivia’s 1979 arms purchases. The appointment as Minister of Finance of a man who lacks experience in economics and banking, and, more importantly, who is unknown to the international financial community, should make it more difficult for Bolivia to obtain credits from legitimate sources, particularly because it appears the government does not intend to implement policies (i.e., substantial price hikes in domestic hydrocarbons) which would gain the support of the IMF.\nAs of April 30, the net international reserves of the Central Bank amounted to $111.2 million, and the bank was approximately $65 million overdrawn in its foreign exchange accounts with other banks. Both the IMF and the Central Bank report heavy buying of dollars by the public during the last two days. This demand for foreign exchange has undoubtedly moved the net international reserves of the consolidated banking system from zero, as reported by the Minister on May 9, into a negative position.\nDuring the next three months, Bolivia owes $68.88 million dollars in debt service payments: May $25.4 million, June $21.649 million; July $21.832 million. In addition, the nation faces heavy current obligations arising from a growing trade imbalance. Imports are said to be approximately 45 percent above 1978 levels for the first quarter, and Central Bank authorities are anticipating a current account deficit of at least $500 million. Unless new financial credits amounting to approximately $100 million are obtained during the next three months, the Padilla government will be unable to meet its foreign payment obligations beginning some time in July. Under present circumstances the Padilla government will have great difficulty raising these credits.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1979LAPAZ04170\nDate: May 11, 1979\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 jan 1960\nConcepts: FINANCIAL CRISIS, GOVERNMENT DEBTS, FINANCIAL RESERVES"

He is widely respected by those outside Bolivia who know him for his rational and direct approach to political problems. One of the founders of the MNR in the 40s, he has not recently been close to Victor Paz and is not a leading insider in that party. Following the 1952 MNR Revolution Guevara served as Foreign Minister (1952-56), Ambassador to France (1956-58) and Minister of Interior (1958-59). Guevara split with Victor Paz in 1959 and formed the Authentic Revolutionary Party, a conservative offshoot of the MNR. In the 1960’s he again served as Foreign Minister (1967-68) and as Bolivia’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations (1968-71). Following several years of exile in the mid-1970’s Guevara returned to Bolivia and allied himself with Paz in both the 1978 and 1979 presidential elections. He was elected Senator from Cochabamba in the July 1979 elections and then President of the Senate from which position he emerged as Bolivia’s interim president when the Congress was unable to choose between either of the two leading vote getters, Hernan Siles or Victor Paz. Although he has at times been critical of the US, Guevara is generally considered to be friendly towards the United States. The US should have a close and cooperative working relationship with Guevara. End summary.\nGuevara was born in the city of Cochabamba on March 12, 1912 and attended primary and secondary school there. After serving in the Chaco War (1932-1935) and being decorated for bravery he graduated from the Law School of the University of San Andres in La Paz. He served as Director of the Miners’ Bank (1937) and as a deputy in the Congress (1938) before being named Secretary-General of Government (1943-44), a position with cabinet rank. During the early 1940’s Guevara participated, along with Victor Paz and Hernan Siles, in the founding of the MNR. He resigned his cabinet position in 1944 to make a successful bid for a seat in the Congress. After election, however, Guevara chose to accept a scholarship for postgraduate work in sociology at the University of Chicago. He remained in the US until 1946 when, following the overthrow of the government of Gualberto Villarroel, Guevara went into exile in Argentina. He returned to Bolivia in 1949 to engage in underground activities for the MNR. Following the MNR’s successful revolution in 1952 Guevara was named Minister of Foreign Relations. Considered a moderate at this time Guevara was forced to resign this position in early 1956 because of a dispute with Juan Lechin, leader of the MNR’s left wing. When Hernan Siles Zuazo was elected president in 1956 Guevara was named Ambassador to France and, in 1957, concurrently to Israel. Guevara returned from France in 1958 to enter the Siles cabinet as Minister of Government. He resigned this position in 1959 in a dispute with Paz and Lechin and formed his own conservative offshoot of the MNR, the Authentic Revolutionary Party (PRA).\nIn 1960 Guevara was the PRA’s candidate for president of Bolivia. Guevara remained estranged from Paz during the latter’s third term (1960-64) and went into exile from 1962 to 1963. He was elected a Senator in the national elections of 1966. From 1967 to 1968 he served as Minister of Foreign Affairs under President Barrientos and in 1968 was named Bolivia’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations. He was dismissed in 1971 and returned to Bolivia. In 1974, following some criticism of the Banzer regime’s policy toward Brazil, he was exiled to Paraguay. He later went to Caracas where he served as an advisor to Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez. Guevara returned to Bolivia in 1978 and patched up his longtime feud with Victor Paz in time to support the latter’s campaign for president in 1978. When those elections were annulled and a new round called for July 1979 Guevara again supported Paz. In the elections Guevara was elected to the Senate from Cochabamba. Subsequently, he was elected President of the Senate from which position he became interim president of Bolivia when the Congress was unable to choose between either of the two leading vote getters in the July elections, Hernan Siles or Victor Paz.\nIn his early years Guevara was known as a leftist and in 1944 he publicly admitted that he was a Marxist and Soviet sympathizer. However, he began to move to the right and in the mid-1950’s he was considered a moderate and by the 1960’s a conservative. When he founded the PRA in 1959 he declared he favored private initiative over economic statism, a responsible and vigorous central government, business-like management of the mining industry, and a labor policy which recognizes that increased productivity is the only non-inflationary source of salary increases. Guevara’s views are not believed to have changed significantly since then.\nHard-working, responsible, realistic, articulate and very intelligent, Guevara is an able negotiator and parliamentarian who gives meticulous attention to detail. He tends to be somewhat pedantic in his manner and at times approaches questions legalistically. Somewhat inscrutable and reserved on first acquaintance, he responds best to directness and simplicity of manner.\nAlthough his strong personal and national pride has sometimes led him to be critical and resentful of the United States, he is generally considered to be friendly toward the US. He speaks good English, in addition to Spanish and French, and in years past was reportedly well-read on matters pertaining to the United States.\nGuevara has been married twice. His first wife, Lola Anaya de Guevara, died in the mid-1950’s. His second wife, Rosa Elena Rodriguez de Guevara, was born in Cochabamba and is 60 years old. He has three sons – Walter (37) who attended St. Lawrence University, Ramiro (24) and Carlos (30). Moderate in his personal habits, Guevara drinks socially, enjoys puns, and in years past played poker, handball and golf, although he has not been seen on the golf course in the past two years.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1979LAPAZ06713\nDate: August 07, 1979\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 jan 1960\nConcepts: BIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION, PRESIDENT, INTERIM GOVERNMENT"

THE GOB NOW PLANS TO SEND A HIGH-LEVEL PRESIDENTIAL ADVISOR TO LIMA TO NEGOTIATE WITH PAZ FOR HIS EVENTUAL SUPPORT. IT IS REASONABLY CLEAR FROM REMARKS MADE BY THE ABOVE SOURCE AND IN FORMER CONVERSATIONS WITH PRESIDENTIAL ADVISORS ARCE AND CAPRILES THAT PRESIDENT BANZER WILL NOT SEEK RE-ELECTION, BUT THAT BANZER WANTS TO HAVE A DECISIVE VOICE IN CHOSING HIS SUCCESSOR AND THEREFOR WANTS TO REMAIN IN OFFICE UNTIL THE ELECTIONS. WHILE IT MAY BE PREMATURE TO SELECT A SUCCESSOR NOW, IT IS CLEAR THAT AN ENDORSEMENT OF PAZ OF A SUCCESSOR CHOSEN BY BANZER AND THE MILITARY HIERARCHY WOULD BE UNBEATABLE IN THE NEXT ELECTIONS.

The measures include a 25 percent devaluation, changes in the interest rates for time deposits and bank loans, changes in commercial bank reserve requirements, wage adjustments, hydrocarbon price increases, creation of a Monetary Stabilization Council, and limitations on GOB public sector expenditures. Much to the dissatisfaction of the commercial bankers, the Central Bank has not completed regulations for the implementation of the new measures. End summary.\nDecree 17123. This decree authorizes the Central Bank to make future exchange rate adjustments while maintaining a two percent difference between the buy and sell rate to cover transaction costs. The decree does not mention the new exchange rate; Minister of Finance Augusto Cuadros Sanchez announced that the GOB had devalued the peso 25 percent setting the new buying rate at 24.51 pesos to the dollar. This decree clearly facilitates future exchange rate adjustments which bankers and the local IMF representative Jorge Sol Perez consider inevitable. The procedure–whether mini-devaluations or infrequent movements of some magnitude–will be the decision of the GOB and will certainly take into account political considerations and the social impact. Until it becomes clear to what extent the Central Bank will honor foreign exchange obligations of the commercial banks and money exchange houses, these institutions are limiting sales of foreign exchange. Although there is no “run” on the financial institutions, the demand exceeds previous normal levels; only a relatively small percentage of customers are being turned away. So far exchange rate expectations of larger firms in the private sector appear mixed. One of the larger customers of one US bank, converted about $US 600,000 to pesos on Dec 3. National banks report, however, that speculation continues; larger firms have not brought back all of the large amounts of dollars converted from pesos before the devaluation.\nThe Decree 17123 requires all exporters from the private and public sector to deliver 100 percent of their export earnings to the Central Bank. Only transactions fees and royalties paid in foreign exchange need not be turned over. The decree also stipulates that public sector agencies and the state enterprises cannot maintain foreign exchange accounts either in Bolivia or outside; any such funds must be delivered to the Central Bank by Dec 10, 1979. All foreign exchange transactions must pass through the Central Bank, which must be informed of the agencies’ monthly foreign exchange requirements. One banker indicated that these restrictions on the public sector agencies were to avoid a recurrence of the large purchases (estimated to be up to $US 60 million) of foreign exchange for speculative purposes which took place the last days of the Natusch regime.\nDecree 17123 forbids banks and money exchange houses from maintaining accounts outside of Bolivia. It also sets the following new limits on total commercial bank short and medium term foreign credits replacing those established by Decree 15719 based on total credits in June 1978:\n\n(Millions of $US)\n\n\n\n\nUp to One Year\nOne to Five Years\nTotal\n\n\n\n\nPrivate Banks\n75\n70\n145\n\n\nState Banks\n25\n45\n70\n\n\nTotal\n100\n115\n215\n\n\n\nBanks surpassing their limits will have their reserve requirement in foreign exchange increased by 100 percent of the excess. It is expected that the Central Bank will allocate individual bank credit ceilings based on their Oct 1979 foreign lines of credit. One banker pointed out that these ceilings will harm the big banks with large existing lines and will be to the advantage of the new, small Bolivian banks. One US banker said the ceilings would have almost no effect on his operations since the local branch acts as an agent between his bank’s branches outside of Bolivia and local firms seeking direct lines of credit. The availability of foreign exchange for payment of foreign debt obligations is of greatest concern to both US and foreign bankers. Most believe that, recognizing the importance of maintaining good relations with foreign commercial banks, the Central Bank will not be too stringent, but will examine each loan on an individual basis for proper registration with the Central Bank. One banker noted that Central Bank record keeping is so poor that he doubts that many loans which his bank took care to register properly will be located on Central Bank records; thus he feels the verification process could be long and involved. According to a US banker, the Central Bank, which did not require registration of direct credit lines to Bolivian firms, may now restrict sales of foreign exchange to firms to preclude any new lines of credit or even a drawing down of existing lines.\n\nDecree 17123 discontinues, as of Nov 30, 1979, the maintenance of value clause for peso savings accounts and peso certificates of deposit. During the first 15 days of March 1980 and perhaps sooner, account holders qualifying for maintenance of value guarantees, will be paid the difference in pesos at the Nov 30 exchange rate. Pesos presently in their account may be withdrawn at any time but the increment will still be paid. By Dec 30, 1979 banks must deliver to the Central Bank the excess\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1979LAPAZ10472\nDate: December 07, 1979\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 jan 1960\nConcepts: ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, ECONOMIC PROGRAMS"

I covered the same ground that I did with the Foreign Minister on Feb. 12 but in more detail. Ostria took notes and was pleased to receive the information which he indicated he would use to guide the Foreign Minister’s conduct and substantive conversations in Mexico.\nOstria said Bolivia understands that it will not play a significant role in the Mexico City Conference, given the power of others and the aggressiveness of a few. He expressed a great interest in having the conference arrive at a consensus that aid providers give preference to assistance to the poorer countries in the region. He feels this is not a bilateral issue in its totality and thus can be raised in a multilateral meeting.\nAs to bilateral matters, Ostria noted that the U.S. and Bolivia have no specific problems, that relations are excellent and that if any minor matters needed to be discussed bilaterally, it is the policy of the Bolivian Government to raise them with the Embassy here in La Paz.\nOstria then briefly touched on a personal idea of his which is long-range achievement of a satisfactory access to the sea by Bolivia based on improving relations with Chile. He said in confidence that the Ministry has an indication that the Chilean Foreign Minister may take the initiative in Mexico to meet with Foreign Minister Guzman to attempt to set the stage for improvement in Bolivian/Chilean relations. Ostria said it is hoped that over time this could be converted into some tangible settlement of Bolivia’s long felt need for a seacoast. He noted another personal idea that some time in the future one or two of the larger countries in the region might wish to lend good offices to assist Chile, Peru and Bolivia in reaching some satisfactory accord.\nOstria is a bright, articulate, friendly career Bolivian diplomat with whom the Embassy has had close and effective working relations for some time. In our view, he will be the key member of the Bolivian delegation.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1974LAPAZ00985\nDate: February 14, 1974\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 JAN 1960\nConcepts: LESS DEVELOPED COUNTRIES, LANDLOCKED COUNTRIES, FOREIGN MINISTERS MEETINGS, FOREIGN POLICY POSITION,"

(The role of Natusch, one of the few charismatic figures in the military, is not clear. A Banzer loyalist but personal friend of Pereda, Natusch berated Pereda on coup day for his disloyalty to the military and his damaging of Bolivia’s international image through an ill-conceived coup. Subsequently, however, Natusch has been helping Pereda pick up the pieces and urging him to save the situation by new elections in 1979.)\nPereda’s main message was that he needed to change his tactics to get military support but that the basic plan was to proceed with announcement of a new election plan, on August 6, if at all possible (although this date is no longer firm). Pereda said that there was opposition to elections, even plotting among some of the “generational” officers. He had decided that a meeting of unit commanders in La Paz was not the way to win over these officers–especially since all of them would not be represented. He had decided, therefore, to cancel the meeting and instead to make a personal whirlwind trip around the country to talk to all of the officers of each of the major units. He said he would meet today (August 1) with La Paz units (mostly Banzer loyalists) and leave tonight on a four-day trip around the country, returning Saturday, August 5. If all went well, we would still go ahead with his speech on August 6.\nPereda described his main problem among some younger officers as exaggerated fear of the left and concern that early elections meant turning over the country to Hernan Siles and his, inter alia, communist supporters. If that was the problem, I said, it ought to be possible to make the point that nothing would strengthen the position of the left more than a protracted period of de facto government and continuing growth of anti-military sentiment which the left was obviously better at exploiting than anyone else. Both Pereda and Natusch said they agreed with this and thought the points could be made, but more effectively in a series of unit meetings than in a large meeting of commanders.\nPereda wanted me to review the US position, stressing that soon US support was going to be needed to consolidate support behind a political plan to avoid chaos. I reviewed our interest in a) early elections and b) internal peace and stability in Bolivia so its people could progress. I said we saw these two as related since a credible plan for return to democratic rule was the best means to gain the needed cooperation of all political elements in the transition process. Pereda said he agreed and that he needed not only cooperation in a political plan, but also tolerance for tough economic measures. He mused that he still faced a difficult time between now and announcement of a new election plan.\nI once again raised the question of whether elections in 1979 would not be the best rallying point for national unity. Natusch opined that he thought 12-18 months from now was the right time for elections. Pereda was noncommittal, pointing out that the military hurdle was now the critical one to get over.\nPereda asked several questions on US “recognition” and aid. I reviewed our position on affirmation of relations as previously presented to Tapia. I also told him that we had not made final decisions on FY78 aid, but that if all went well it would still be possible to sign some aid assistance in August, if this would be helpful in consolidating a good democratization plan.\nComment. Pereda obviously does not have all his ducks lined up yet for any election plan. He is working hard on this, but his own weak position and the bitter legacy of the coup are serious disadvantages.

As the executive and legislative branches thus shake down to one another, the major political groups are beginning to try to organize themselves for next year’s elections. Although the UDP, the MNR Alliance and the ADN have all publicly expressed optimism about the political future, their real perspectives are considerably more complex. The UDP is still plagued by the internal tensions that almost pulled it apart earlier in the year; the MNR Alliance has not yet found a way of accommodating the ambitions of some of its younger (albeit middle-aged) leaders; and the ADN, chiefly concerned with the anti-Banzer accusations in Congress, may maneuver for elections in 1981, instead of next year. The armed forces, in the meantime, have accomplished their retreat to the barracks smoothly. Against this background, attention is now beginning to focus increasingly upon the labor sector, which is still considering how–or whether–to press its demands for significant wage hikes. End summary.\nIn the past two weeks, the interim government of President Walter Guevara and the Congress that elected him have begun to shake down to one another. Relations between the two entities, generally speaking, have been tentative and cordial. On August 23, however, a confrontation erupted when Guevara decided to fill several upper-level positions at COMIBOL, the state mining corporation, without bothering to consult the Chamber of Deputies first, in accordance with Act 62 of the Constitution. Crying foul, the deputies promptly issued a resolution pointing out that it was the lower house’s constitutional prerogative to submit a list of three candidates for “social and economic” positions in all state corporations. Later that same evening, Guevara responded, in effect, with a demurrer. He acknowledged that the legislature’s rights were as stated and said that he had no intention of usurping them. But, he added, allowances must be made for the special circumstances that obtain during a “transitional” government. The appointments, therefore would stick. In response, the deputies threatened interpellation of ministers, which prompted the President to seek a meeting with the leadership of both houses and reach an accommodation. There will be no interpellation as such, but ministers will agree to present reports on their activities to the Congress. In return, the government will henceforth respect the legislature’s prerogatives under Article 62 to submit three nominees for top managerial jobs in the state enterprises. (Comment: Guevara appears to have made a tactical error by overlooking the legislative prerogative, probably by oversight rather than design. The issue now appears to have been satisfactorily accommodated, but the new Congress made its point and has effectively served notice on the government. Despite the flare-up between executive and legislature, however, the honeymoon appears to continue on course. End comment).\nAs the government and the Congress feel their way forward, the major political groups have begun to reorganize and to look toward the future. Spokesmen for the MNR, the UDP and the ADN have publicly proclaimed that Victor Paz Estenssoro, Hernan Siles and Hugo Banzer will again head their respective slates in the elections scheduled for May 4 next year. Underlying these proclamations, however, are considerably more complex realities.\n\n\nThe UDP, as earlier in the year, is experiencing internal strains. The mainstay MNRI party is divided on whether to permit Siles to run again with an MIR vice presidential candidate. The Moscow-line Communists (PCB) share these re-emerging reservations about the MIR, while the MIR members themselves have not resolved whether their standard bearer next round should be Jaime Paz (as in 1979) or Antonio Aranibar, currently a lower house deputy. Another point of contention is the scope of the next elections: the MNRI wants them to be general, rather than simply for President and Vice President; the Communists, on the other hand, do not want to risk their newly-won congressional seats.\nThe MNR Alliance is hardly more unified. Victor Paz remains the “indispensable” leader, but, according to a good source, he refuses to allow an objective review of 1979 election errors. Moreover, he remains resistant to “generational” pressures from ambitious young leaders such as Robert Jordan\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1979LAPAZ07386\nDate: August 30, 1979\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 jan 1960\nConcepts: DISPUTES, PRESIDENT, TRENDS, POLITICAL LEADERS, POLITICAL SUMMARIES, CENTRAL LEGISLATURE"

On the contrary, the allocation of fixed numbers of government ministries to the FSB and the MNR and the need to give priority to political patronage in making all appointments to government office (national and local) had created an unwieldy, largely ineffectual bureaucracy. In turn, the two parties – entrenched in their ministries, with their smaller bureaucratic followings – hampered the implementation of development programs and contributed to a generalized discontent in the body politic, including within the military establishment.\nThe President has now taken the opportunity to at last disengage from the FPN scheme of government by seizing upon the national concern for an outlet to the sea, making this issue the vehicle for a campaign to achieve national political unity and the end of political partisanship. By one major initiative: the Gran Consulta Nacional in Cochabamba, the President wrested approval from most of the political personages assembled (including representatives of the FSB and the MNR) for a free hand in reorganizing the government without regard to political party concerns. In addition, he orchestrated – by prior arrangement – the presentation of a document by the Armed Forces which called for the very program of action eventually adopted by the meeting. The rationale behind giving the President a free hand to reorganize the government along non-partisan, technical lines is that Bolivia must be economically strong and politically stable if it is to succeed in the eventual negotiations for a sea outlet.\nTo help the Executive in its development tasks, a National Consultative Council will be nominated, consisting of approximately fifty persons of national stature, to draw up policy papers recommending approaches to a broad spectrum of political, economic, and social problem areas. On the political side, this Council will devise a formula to encourage the formation of a single party of National Reconciliation, which will gather together all those elements who are neither of the extreme left nor extreme right. The model is likely to be that of the PRI in Mexico. In any case, direct popular elections are not likely to be held in the foreseeable future; rather, some method of indirect election or referendum may be devised to effect a succession in the office of President sometime in 1975.\nThere will be a number of cabinet changes in the next week or two which will see some MNR and FSB ministers depart the scene. The caliber of the new cabinet appointments, as well as the representative character of the appointments to the National Council, will be important in assessing the degree of support the President can expect in the future from the Armed Forces and key civilian opinion-makers.\n\nIn any event, however, we may expect that elements in both the MNR and the FSB – who recently argued in favor of their parties’ withdrawal from the dying FPN – will now advocate the political advantage of distancing themselves from a government in which the two parties no longer have a significant role to play.\nThe PDC-PRA did not sign the so-called “Declaration of Cochabamba.” Guevara Arze’s comments decrying the lack of meaningful debate or dialogue at the Cochabamba meeting have put him at the head of the dissenting faction in the new political scheme of things. If, in spite of this dissent, he is still appointed to the National Council (as an expert in foreign relations), the prospects of eventually organizing single political force would be improved.\nAlthough we have not received any news of organized opposition or protest over these political developments, the GOB evidently decided to take no chances and proceeded to arrest about 15 labor leaders as a preventive measure.\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1974LAPAZ02200\nDate: April 08, 1974\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 JAN 1960\nConcepts: PRESIDENT, CABINET, REORGANIZATIONS, POLITICAL SITUATION, POLITICAL PARTIES"

News stories and commentaries appearing in La Paz press almost daily. Meeting and its importance being noted to mission personnel by leading Bolivians. Foreign Ministry officials state they working hard on positions for each agenda item and hope to have constructive and active Bolivian participation in sessions. Embassy believes Bolivian delegation will be helpful in conciliatory role and in drafting committees where felicitous choice of phraseology is important.\nMajor recurring theme, virtually a consensus, is belief that meeting with Secretary Kissinger is major opportunity to strengthen US-Latin relations. Most Bolivians express open admiration for Secretary’s accomplishments and for his boldness in tackling and solving seemingly impossible international problems.\nWhile we are gratified by rising attention to Foreign Ministers’ meeting, there is risk that Bolivians may be expecting something dramatic to occur in our relations immediately and thus may be disappointed if results of meeting do not match their aspirations. Other difficulty in local interest about meeting with Secretary is generalized assumption that he will “solve” Cuban problem. Although official GOB policy remains anti-Cuba, which most Bolivians share, there is often stated view that Cuban problem is ready-made for Secretary’s style of diplomacy.\nWe sense the following general views of the GOB: A. Poorer nations deserve greater share of lending agencies resources at long-term low interest rates; B. Less developed countries should have preference in markets of industrialized nations; C. Countries producing basic commodities should have guaranteed protection against sudden and sharp drops in prices or compensation mechanism to offset balance of payments losses; D. Arrangements should be made to continue to supply food to those countries having chronic deficit in domestic production of such commodities as wheat; E. Industrialized countries should establish means of holding down prices of machinery exports so that terms of trade will be more favorable to LDCs. F. Some compensation should be awarded Bolivia by other nations from their exploitation of resources from the sea, since Bolivia has been deprived of her seacoast. G. Hemispheric support for Bolivia’s claim to an outlet to the Pacific should be forthcoming in the same way that Panama obtained hemispheric support for its claim against USG.\nIf Bolivian Foreign Minister were to have bilateral meeting with Secretary Kissinger, he could be expected to make following points: A. Bolivia is friend of U.S.; B. Bolivia is target for international communist agitation to establish new base of intrigue and conspiracy on continent; C. GOB wishes to have another program loan to finance economic and social development projects managed by the Presidency; D. GOB is unhappy at slow deliveries of military equipment in our military assistance programs; E. GOB would like US support of Bolivia’s aspirations to regain a passage to the sea and to have her own seaport; F. Inter-American system should not be dominated by large Latin American countries; G. US should take more active role in hemisphere affairs, stepping up its cultural, military, political, and economic programs, especially in the less developed countries; H. While admitting price of tin currently high, still Bolivia needs such prices. If tin price drops, GSA sales is partly to blame, so US should consider compensation.\n\nComment: Really key issues for Bolivia are under paragraph 4C and G. No blast on GSA sales from stockpiles anticipated.\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1974LAPAZ00878\nDate: February 08, 1974\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 JAN 1960\nConcepts: PRESS COMMENTS, MEETING AGENDA, FOREIGN RELATIONS, LESS DEVELOPED COUNTRIES, FOREIGN MINISTERS"

Perhaps because of its size, this project has been the subject of considerable public controversy in recent months. During October the president of Bolivia’s Central Bank stated publicly that he did not believe the price increases demanded by Klockner (most recently from $137 to $150 million) were justified, or that the internal rate of return expected from the investment was sufficient to support the expenditure. Rather than sign the guarantee required for the project, the Central Bank president resigned.\nFrom what we know of evaluations made of the Klockner proposal, which offers Soviet technology that apparently has not yet been applied on a commercial scale, there are grounds for questioning the profitability of this sizeable investment. As Bolivia is now facing a severe financial crunch (debt service may rise to 34 percent of exports in 1979, and the balance of payments deficit in 1978 is estimated at over $100 million, with exports growing at about five percent and imports at 20 percent per year), it is understandable that the new government would wish to examine the project with care.\nFYI. It has been widely rumored that substantial financial payments have been made by Klockner or its local representatives to secure approval of this project.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1979LAPAZ00177\nDate: January 08, 1979\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 jan 1960\nConcepts: SILVER, CONSTRUCTION, FOREIGN INVESTMENT, LEAD, PROGRAMS (PROJECTS), PROPOSALS (BID)"

PEREDA CLAIMED THAT THE GOB HAS PROOF THAT PRADO HAD JOINED FORCES WITH LEFTIST EXILES TO OVERTHROW THE BANZER GOVERNMENT. FIFTEEN OTHER PERSONS HAVE BEEN ARRESTED WITH PRADO, INCLUDING SECOND LIEUTENANT CARLOS PRADO YEPEZ AND TWO PROFESSORS AT SAN ANDRES UNIVERSITY IN LA PAZ.

He urged that FARMABOL rep Hathorn respond to Sanchez’s last letter of December 20, 1973 and if possible come to La Paz to pursue negotiations.\nSanchez claims to be under considerable pressure from his superiors to settle FARMABOL matter in Bolivian courts. He said FANAQUINA’s lawyer advises that with evidence available, especially inventory comparisons, legal action would almost certainly result in deposit by FANAQUINA of approximately US$ 5,000 with court as settlement. Owners of FARMABOL would then have to seek funds from court in separate action since Sanchez claims FARMABOL never established legal status in Bolivia. EMBOFF observed that lawyer’s suggestion would unnecessarily complicate case at this point and advised delay until negotiations with Hathorn could be resumed. Sanchez agreed.\nSanchez admitted that he has not yet written directly to Hathorn inviting him to return to La Paz but promised to do so immediately. As Department aware, Hathorn’s fiduciary deposit scheme was turned down by GOB financial advisors but Sanchez believes Hathorn can either convince GOB of value of scheme or offer some other proposal. Sanchez himself seems to prefer amicable negotiated settlement rather than legal action in part because he sees possibility of further capitalizations FANAQUINA and other COFADENA projects.\nAction requested: Department may wish to inform Hathorn of Sanchez’ expressed desire for continued negotiations, possibility of court action and Sanchez’ invitation.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1974LAPAZ01649\nDate: March 18, 1974\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 JAN 1960\nConcepts: INDUSTRY, MONEY, NEGOTIATIONS, COURTS, FINANCIAL AGREEMENTS"

I come to tell you that in history and in international affairs, there are no miracles. If we do not face up to this harsh reality with discipline and energy implicit in great historic enterprises, we risk the indefinite continuation of that painful frustration which weighs on our conscience.\nHere, before the portrait of the great Andes de Santa Cruz and before the tender but energetic eyes of the Madre Patria, having as a witness the flag which flew over our sea coast, I have come to consult with you about the effort and the sacrifices that the Bolivian people must make, with the dignity which is part of our nature, in order to regain the sea which belonged to Bolivia, and that by the force of logic and justice will definitely be Bolivian again.\nI have come to consult with you about the possibility of uniting all Bolivians about the armed forces of the nation in order to attain the historic goal of returning to the sea. Unity within a framework of shared rights and obligations, with strong ties of solidarity and mutual respect, in the common hope of having a prosperous country which enjoys dignity and a connection to the rest of the world.\nI have come to consult with you about the general effort which has to be made to attain the development that will permit us to “return to the sea”. Development which includes all aspects of our society, that will be a permanent process to improve and change the economy, culture and politics of the country. But above all, development to give all Bolivians what has been denied for so long: the means by which they can live happily, with faith in the future.\nFor my government, mere economic growth has little meaning; the greater volume of investments we receive, the use of advanced technology, the use of our natural resources, acquire historic value only insofar as they respond to the needs of the Bolivian people.\nI have come to consult with you about the creation of new mechanisms of political participation which will permit us to strengthen the structures of the state for a “return to the sea”.\n(I ask for) participation of the broadest sectors of the people in the awareness of discussion about national problems.\nFor my government, participation is a right but it is also a serious responsibility.\nIt is not just the use of the advantages and benefits deriving from power, nor the obtaining of positions to satisfy personal interest. Participation is a service to the country which requires discipline, honesty, sacrifice and creative passion.\nI have come to consult with you about the possibility of establishing a government of national participation in order to “return to the sea”.\nI respect the political parties; there exist organizations with tradition and long years of struggle which form a part of our history. I have witnessed the loyal and consistent manner in which the political parties forming the Nationalist Popular Front have acted. From this supra-party institution I have received sincere and devoted cooperation. But the tasks of development, and the subsequent return to the sea, require a general action, a full mobilization of all the people.\nNone of the political parties alone, no one institution acting separately from other structures, is in a position to be the protagonist in the creative adventure of development.\nThe return to the sea requires the conscientious and willing unity of all Bolivians.\nA society such as the one we are seeking must widen participation, but at the same time define the norms of social conduct so that such participation will be useful and not disruptive.\nConsidering that the best of the Bolivian people and a small but worthy representation of Bolivian women is represented here, I have come to talk to you with the responsibilities of a governor who is concerned about the future, with the clarity and sincerity of a man who loves his country with a hard and demanding love, with the modesty of a soldier formed for duty and sacrifice, and with the hope of being understood in the exact meaning of my ideas and concerns.\nI ask you for the first time to put aside personal or group interests and to consider the interests of the country, let us make here, at this place, before the Madre Patria and the memory of those who have given their lives fighting against injustice, the decision we are bound to make as men and as Bolivians.\nWhat I ask for is unity, development and national participation, based upon the responsibility we have toward future generations.\nIn the awareness of the challenge that this consultation implies, I am prepared for any sacrifice that may be necessary, including my withdrawal from the high mission that has been bestowed upon me.\nGentlemen: Our land-locked situation is old, but the conscience of this land-locked situation and the decision to return to the sea is ours today. Let us do everything possible so that later we shall not share the bitter frustration of those who do not wish to work for the fatherland.

POR SU PARTE, EL EMBAJADOR DE LOS ESTADOS UNIDOS, WILLIAM P STEDMAN, REQUERIDO POR LA PRENSA DECLARO QUE LA RENUNCIA DE NIXON RESULTABA UNA OCASION TRISTE “PERO SERVIA PARA DEMOSTRAR DE FUERZA DE LAS INSTITUCIONES NORTEAMERICANAS” .

One possible medium-term solution being discussed within the GOB is a petroleum swap with Brazil.\nThe Problem: Although declining, Bolivia’s current crude production is approximately 31,000 BPD while consumption totals only 24-25,000 BPD. Nevertheless, the extreme lightness of Bolivian crude requires that the entire production be refined in country to supply needed heavy components. However, as consumption continues to rise (it has been increasing at 10 percent annually) and production declines, a point will be reached where local crude production will fail to provide the necessary 10,000 BPD of diesel, kerosene, jet fuel and fuel oil. This could occur as early as mid-1979 even though at that point domestic crude production will still substantially exceed domestic crude consumption. (Bolivia halted crude exports, all of which had been going to Argentina, in October 1978.)\nThe resulting 2,000-3000 BPD heavy fuel shortfall: Beginning some time during the latter half of this year could, of course, be dealt with by importing either crude or heavy product. However, importation presents a major transportation problem. The existing La Paz to Arica (Chile) pipeline is largely gravity operated and to reverse the flow would require a substantial new investment in pumping equipment. The only other transport alternatives – a narrow gauge railroad from Arica and an often impassable parallel highway– present their own serious problems.\nA Brazilian solution? Faced with intermittent gasoline shortages in Western Mato Grosso, Petrobras has privately offered YPFB a trade: Brazilian crude for Bolivian gasoline on a barrel-for-barrel basis. However, according to Bolivian government sources, the Brazilian offer has, at least for now, been declined. The reason given is that with Bolivian gasoline worth more than an equal volume of Brazilian-supplied crude, the deal is inequitable.\nComment: The GOB could of course continue to export its excess gasoline and use the resultant foreign exchange to buy crude. But transportation remains a problem unless Petrobras agrees to simply sell crude rather than swap it for gasoline, a deal the Brazilian entity is reportedly presently unwilling to make. In spite of YPFB head Col. Jose Patino’s initial rejection of the proposed Petrobras swap, it is likely the deal (perhaps sweetened somewhat by the Brazilians) will look increasingly attractive as the need to import the first shipment of crude approaches. In part, the appeal of the Petrobras offer is that a swap will avoid highlighting the continuation of the GOB’s present subsidy of domestic fuel consumption. Importing world-market crude or product at higher unit prices than the fuel is resold for domestically will dramatize the subsidy and embarrass the GOB with local and foreign critics of its economic policies. By contrast, a swap would be far less dramatic and may well in the end prove irresistible to a government which is both loathe to raise fuel prices and embarrassed to highlight the fact that the country’s once widely-touted oil wealth is no longer sufficient to fulfill even its own needs.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1979LAPAZ02086\nDate: March 10, 1979\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 jan 1960\nConcepts: PETROLEUM, GASOLINE, TRADE AGREEMENTS"

Charges against the exiles were (in paraphrase): A) Attempt to change the nature of the Revolution of August 1971; B) Attempt to create divisions within the Armed Forces and Police; C) Systematic agitation among the ranks of organized labor to create anarchy and social discord; D) Unwillingness to accept the responsibility these persons had in the passage of the so-called economic package last October-November; E) Contact with the extreme left both within and outside of the country with patently subversive purposes; and F) Extortion of funds from industry for conspiratorial ends. (Note: This last charge evidently refers to the MNR campaign to raise contributions from party members and the public to defray the costs of the proposed convention.)\nAlso on January 8, Ciro Humboldt issued a communique announcing his assumption of the duties of MNR chief ad interim. Dr. Humboldt stated that he has warned VPE of the need to work for party and national unity but that his efforts had been in vain. Humboldt, with an extraordinary display of cynicism, then criticized VPE for passively accepting his exile and abandoning his followers. Humboldt also announced the postponement of the MNR convention until August 1974. At the same time, the various dissidents to VPE’s leadership, issued a communique in the name of the MNR criticizing Dr. Paz’ autocratic rule and pledging the party’s support to the FPN and President Banzer. Among dissident leaders signing this document were Humboldt, Executive Secretary Ruben Julio, Secretary General Juan Jose Rivero and the MNR ministers in the GOB.\nThe meeting of Dr. Paz with the Minister of Interior in the morning of January 8 (see reftel) was attended by ranking officers of the Armed Forces so it is clear that the decision to exile the MNR leader had the backing of the upper echelons of the military institution.\nIt is possible that other followers of Dr. Paz may be exiled in the near future.\nComment: With the exile of VPE, the leader of Bolivia’s largest political party, the government of President Banzer will appear more authoritarian than at any time in the past, both at home and abroad. It remains to be seen, but it appears unlikely that the public will accept the Humboldt-led party as the true MNR. Thus, the military, already considered the significant force behind the administration, will be awarded the primary responsibility for the accomplishments and failures of the Banzer government. This, in turn, should increase the military’s interest in the day-to-day operations of the government. It would appear that although Banzer has removed a rival of great skill, he has limited his room for political maneuver and increased further his already significant dependence on the Armed Forces. Although we do not foresee any imminent political upheavals resulting from this action, there is some concern that the decapitation of the political middle ground may have longer term consequences of polarizing political activity in Bolivia between far right and far left.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1974LAPAZ00158\nDate: January 09, 1974\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 JAN 1960\nConcepts: EXILES, ANARCHY, SOCIAL CHANGE, CIVIL DISORDERS, EXTORTION, COMMUNIQUES, PARTY MEETINGS, PARTY LEADERS,"

(During the first three quarters of this year YPFB produced 7.61 million barrels; during the same nine months last year production was 8.96 million.)\nWith the country’s oil production-consumption currently in rough balance (see para 4), further production slippage would soon require Bolivia to begin using its ever scarcer foreign exchange to import costly spot market crude and/or product. However, that painful step may not be necessary in the short or medium run. Increasingly strong inductions are that Dallas-based Tesoro Petroleum’s La Vertiente field in southern Bolivia could soon produce enough petroleum to allow YPFB to avoid imports. After having drilled five holes on the structure (one which, ironically, YPFB drilled unsuccessfully hears ago) Tesoro believes La Vertiente could pump 10 to 12 thousand barrels per day, or one half national consumption. (However, far from being euphoric over their success, Tesoro is seriously worried that it will attract too much attention and generate left-wing sentiment for nationalization.)\nGas marketing remains a problem: It’s increasingly clear that Bolivian hopes of selling additional quantities of higher-priced natural gas to neighboring Argentina are groundless. Moreover, it now appears that the Argentines are unwilling even to agree to a real price hike for the volumes of gas they are now receiving from Bolivia. Recent Argentine gas discoveries support the GOA’s hardline posotion on purchases from Bolivia. The new government is, however, pressing agead with drilling to verify its gas reserves, preparatory to pipeline negotiations with Brazil.\nBolivia’s current supply-demand status: With production falling and demand still increasing Bolivia is still barely able to supply itself with petroleum. By refining all of its current output, YPFB can just supply the country’s demand for diesel, fuel oil and kerosene while producing a modest gasoline surplus.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1979LAPAZ10169\nDate: November 27, 1979\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 jan 1960\nConcepts: PETROLEUM PRODUCTS, PRODUCTION TRENDS"

EMBASSY MAY RECOMMEND AGAINST INSURANCE FOR NEW JERSEY ZINC ON SIMILAR GROUNDS, BUT LACKS SUFFICIENT INFORMATION. END SUMMARY.\n        \n            \n    \n    \n  \n\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE TELEGRAM\nUNCLASSIFIED\n\nOn basis of info available to it, Embassy recommends against OPIC insurance for Lone Star Bolivia Group (registration No. 511-74-232) on same grounds on which it based its recommendation against OPIC insurance for Union Oil Co. Embassy’s reasoning is presented in Refs A and B and still appear to be valid. As in case of Union, Lone Star appears quite willing enter into contract in Bolivia without insurance and that it not essential in company’s decision to commit resources over time.\nAlso on basis limited info now available to it, Embassy may recommend against OPIC insurance for New Jersey Zinc (registration No. 511-74-339). As stated Ref C, para 2, we believe USG now well out or almost out (OPIC still has insurance on SAPI and FNCB interest in COMSUR) of sensitive mining sector, should have bias against insurance for extractive industries and should consider new entries on most carefully selective basis. NJZ appears to have made its decision in advance of assurance that it will have OPIC insurance. It has already paid US$ 240,000 of Tye’s debts (in this case to Banco Minero). In these circumstances OPIC insurance does not appear to be necessary. We view any investment in mining sector as highly risky and greatly exposed to vagaries of Bolivian nationalism.\nWe suspect GOB will oppose OPIC insurance for NJZ on basis of experience in Mina Matilde settlement in which, even with help of OPIC insured medium term loan, price COMIBOL has to pay increased from US$ 13.4 million to over US$ 18 million due necessity borrowing from banks in order to pay U.S. Steel and Engelhard cash on barrel head.\nOn other hand, NJZ highly competent and financially strong firm (especially as it is subsidiary of Gulf and Western) and, we understand, is considering taking in strong Bolivian firm, COMSUR, as partners. Huari-Huari Mine is rich and probably will be very rewarding mine if properly developed and adequate mill is constructed to separate zinc, tin and silver from its complex ores. Investment will undoubtedly make strong impact on investment climate, economic development and balance of payments, but, we repeat, investment seems already assured.\nAppears that portion of insurance sought by NJZ may cover investments in mine development already made by Frank Tye (Gibraltar Huari-Huari Corp.). Tye reportedly developed about one half million tons of ore.\nNew factors affecting decisions on mining and hydrocarbons sectors are rising prices and shortages these commodities. These factors usually should tend to induce more investment these sectors without need for OPIC insurance. This appears be true with regard both Lone Star and New Jersey Zinc, but USG may find cases where OPIC insurance desired to help solve problems posed by such shortages.\nEmbassy investigating Verne Hutchinson Cattle Ranch Project (registration No. 511-74-208) and Clair Peterson Cotton Project (registration No. 511-74-170) and will report.\nWe note OPIC letters refer to Ministry of Economy which has not existed for several years. Ministry now known as Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Tourism.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1974LAPAZ02284\nDate: April 10, 1974\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 JAN 1960\nConcepts: INSURANCE, BUSINESS FIRMS, MINING INDUSTRY, LOANS"

Col. Natusch Busch, has arranged to call on me Monday, January 14, at 10 a.m. to discuss a matter of great importance. I can only conclude that he wishes to talk about the critical wheat and flour problem in Bolivia. Accordingly, I would very much appreciate having an official position to be able to give him during next week’s meeting.\nThis morning, January 9, during a courtesy call on the Foreign Minister by Congressman Whalen, I was told by the Foreign Minister how important U.S. cooperation in helping Bolivia with wheat will be in the present critical situation. On January 8, the Subsecretary of the Foreign Ministry, Dr. Cespedes, telephoned me to inquire whether there was any current information on Bolivia’s request for PL-480 wheat. In reply both to the Foreign Minister and the Subsecretary, I said that I had no official reply but I had preliminary indications that the chances were unlikely that there would be any new agreements during the balance of FY 74.\nIn addition to an official position which I can present to the Minister of Agriculture on January 14, which I hope will provide some help to Bolivia at this critical time, I would like to know what the facts are with regard to supply and demand for US wheat and whether there will be any PL-480 programs at all in this fiscal year and if so, which countries will be receiving allocations. I do not intend to convey this information to Bolivians but would like to have the information for our own understanding of the situation. We recognize the difficulties confronting the agencies in Washington in making determinations under present circumstances but we here feel woefully short of statistics and facts. In another vein, I trust that sympathetic consideration is being given to Bolivia’s request so that helpful alternatives to PL-480 can be offered, if necessary, such as suitable credit.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1974LAPAZ00173\nDate: January 09, 1974\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 JAN 1960\nConcepts: FOOD SHORTAGE, WHEAT, AGRICULTURAL AGREEMENTS, PL 480 TITLE 1, NEGOTIATIONS"

STATE 48030\n        \n            \n    \n    \n  \n\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE TELEGRAM\nUNCLASSIFIED\n\nOn March 19 I handed text of following Aide Memoire to Acting President General Guzman in the Presidential Palace:\n\n“The Department of State has informed the Embassy that it has carefully reviewed the Government of Bolivia’s request for financial assistance for the reconstruction of flood damage. The Department has expressed the view that there should be first an assessment of the flood damage and the requirements for reconstruction, and that this analysis be conducted with the assistance of representatives of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Inter-American Development Bank, as well as the Agency for International Development. The Department suggests that the Government of Bolivia consider requesting perhaps through the auspices of CIAP, the multilateral agencies to undertake a joint survey. In any event, the United States is willing to provide experts from AID Washington to assist the Government of Bolivia in this assessment.\n“After the assessment of damage and of reconstruction requirements is completed, the Department believes that it could form the basis for a Bolivian Government request for assistance to the financial agencies located in Washington. The United States believes that the IBRD and IDB have resource availabilities sufficient to assist in Bolivian reconstruction without serious distortion of their programs elsewhere. This would not be the case with AID assistance. For AID, any significant financing for reconstruction might necessitate a special authorization and appropriation from the United States Congress. Given the history of Congressional responses to such requests, it appears that the only way AID would be able to help in the near term in reconstruction efforts would be within the existing funding levels. This would mean that assistance for flood reconstruction would have to be subtracted from planned development lending programs. A decision on this would appropriately await the completion of the assessment. Furthermore, the implementation plans for AID loans planned in FY 75 could be designed to have maximum effect in support of reconstruction efforts. The Government of Bolivia may also wish to consider the feasibility of reprogramming local currency generated by prior PL-480 sales and program loans to cover a portion of the reconstruction effort. The United States will actively support Bolivian requests for the multilateral assessment of damage and to examine with the Government of Bolivia the most feasible means of financing those requirements, including the multilateral agencies.”\n\nIn addition to the text of the Aide Memoire, I explained to the Acting President that the Department viewed the reconstruction matter in two phases–the first the assessment and the second the financing. It was our preference that both be conducted by multilateral cooperation. Nonetheless, we were prepared to assist in the assessment without the World Bank and the IDB if that were the GOB desire. I explained the limitations on AID financial assistance in line with the two State telegrams under reference. I noted that press information in La Paz suggested that the Bolivians were already preparing a letter to President McNamara of the IBRD asking for reconstruction assistance for railroads and roads. This, I noted, would be a natural area for the IBRD particularly since they were already contemplating additional financial help for railroads. I noted that Bolivia might well take advantage of a high level IDB mission soon to visit La Paz and the Santiago IDB meeting to discuss with IDB participation in the assessment and subsequent financing of reconstruction effort.\nActing President Guzman thanked me for the reply from Washington to the Bolivian request for reconstruction assistance and indicated that he would discuss our conversation and the Aide Memoire with President Banzer as soon as he could after Banzer’s return to La Paz, scheduled for 6 P.M., March 19. He noted that dividing the operation into two parts made sense and that a survey of the damage and requirements was obviously a logical first step. He indicated his understanding of the limitations on AID financial participation but expressed the hope that even though greater reliance might be placed on IBRD and IDB, some USG financial participation be provided in the reconstruction effort which was so important to the country’s economy.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1974LAPAZ01673\nDate: March 19, 1974\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 JAN 1960\nConcepts: DISASTER RELIEF, ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE, FLOODS, ECONOMIC RECONSTRUCTION, DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS,"

First, would you be kind enough to inform us what is meant by “We are willing to collaborate with the GOB in assessing flood damage and reconstruction requirements.” Next, would appreciate clarification whether statement in para 3 that we would support reasonable request to IDB and IBRD means that we would not be willing to entertain request to AID. Note that para 2 speaks of “limited development loan resources” but does not preclude receipt for consideration of reconstruction loan request. Finally, I would prefer not to use “Bolivia’s windfall petroleum earnings” in discussing reconstruction assistance with Foreign Minister. While prices for Bolivia’s petroleum exports have risen considerably, there is as yet no guarantee that current prices will hold during the year nor that proceeds from taxation on petroleum will not be required to cover budgetary expenditures and investment needs. I would also like to note that Declaration of Tlatelolco in section 4, para 7 states “The Foreign Ministers agree that one of the principal objectives is the accelerated development of the countries of the Americas and the promotion of the welfare of all their peoples. In this regard, the U.S. accepts a special responsibility; and the more developed countries of the Americas recognize that special attention should be paid to the needs of the lesser developed.” As Bolivia has the lowest GNP per capita of any country on the continent of Latin America, it is viewing with special interest this particular section of the Mexico City Declaration.\nI would prefer to be able to state specifically that US will collaborate in assessing flood damage and reconstruction requirements together with IDB and IBRD that assessment could be used as basis for GOB request to IDB and also to IBRD and also to AID. It would also seem logical to me that we suggest to the Foreign Minister that Bolivia make use of the forthcoming CIAP country review to articulate its reconstruction requirements. Min-Coordination told USAID Director he is considering this approach.\nRegarding assistance for Coca crop substitution, we have enough to go on in view of Ambassador Handley’s Feb. 25 letter, the recent visit by ARA Narcotics Advisor Shankle, and para 4 of reftel. We are planning to initial an initial analysis through AID funding apart from sector analysis.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1974LAPAZ01485\nDate: March 11, 1974\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 JAN 1960\nConcepts: DISASTER RELIEF, AGREEMENT DRAFT, PETROLEUM, LOAN AGREEMENTS, FLOODS, PRICES"

Dollar amount allocated this amendment represents first tranche of FY 1980 Title I budget allocation for Bolivia. Balance of FY 1980 budget allocation will be programmed as explained Ref (F). However, during negotiation this amendment it should be noted to GOB representatives that debt arrearage of approximately DOLS 3.0 million, some dating back to November 1977, exists on prior Title I agreements. GOB may encounter USG reluctance to proceed expeditiously with programming further amendments in absence of assurance that steps are being taken to remedy delinquent payments situation.\nSpecifically, amendment provides DOLS 5.0 million to supply approximately 26,000 metric tons wheat/wheat flour in a Calendar Year 1980 supply period. Usual marketing requirements are extended through CY 1980 at level previously established for CY 1979 and import period is so amended. Export limitations are also extended for CY 1980. During negotiations you may explain to GOB representatives that CY 1980 supply period does not prohibit GOB from initiating purchases during December, with deliveries to begin as soon as possible after January 1, 1980.\nNote that before purchase authorization can be issued, USDA/OGSM must receive operational reporting cable marked Priority and pass Agriculture electronically, as required by Ref C, Para 11 C. See Ref D for summary of information required.\nFollowing is text draft note (unnecessary words omitted) which you will be authorized exchange with GOB septel.\n\nBegin Text Note –\nExcellency, have honor to refer Agricultural Commodities Agreement signed by representatives of our two governments May 31, 1978, as amended by exchanges of notes dated August 31, 1978 and September 1, 1978, May 2, 1979, and September 13, 1979 and September 24, 1979, and to propose that Part II, Particular Provisions of that agreement be further amended as follows:\nA. In Item I, Commodity Table, under appropriate column headings, insert a new line as follows: “Wheat/Wheat Flour (wheat basis) - 1980 - 26,000 - 5.0.” On line entitled “Total”, delete “DOLS 22.8” and insert “DOLS 27.8.”\nB. In Item III, Usual Marketing Table, under column headed “Import Period”, change “1979” to read “1979 and 1980.” Under column headed “Usual Marketing Requirement (metric tons)”, change “159,700” to read “159,700 in each year.”\nC. In Item IV, Export Limitations, Paragraph A, change “United States Calendar Year 1978 and 1979” to “United States Calendar Years 1978, 1979, and 1980.”\nAll other terms and conditions of May 31, 1978 agreement as amended, remain the same.\nIf foregoing acceptable to your government, propose that this note, together with your reply thereto, constitute agreement between our two governments, effective date your note in reply.\nAccept, Excellency, etc.\nEnd Text Note\n\nWhen notes exchanged, notify Washington by immediate cable tagged EAID, and marked AIDAC and pass Agriculture electronically, and forward documents per 11 FAM 723.7. Decontrolled upon exchange of notes. End quote.

These unhappy phenomena gave rise to a current account deficit of $385.1 million. Year-end short-term borrowings, which appear to have amounted to approximately $100 million, held the balance of payments deficit to an estimated $123.3 million.\nThe Padilla government has not and almost certainly will not adopt economic measures that will arrest the deterioration which is so evident from the 1978 results. Import growth is said to be continuing, and we do not expect a net increase in export earnings. The key to Bolivia’s balance of payments results in 1979 will be the management of the capital account. As disbursements under USAID and World Bank loans are being limited by a shortage of Bolivian counterpart funds, thereby reducing inflows from these sources, the capital account balance will depend heavily upon the government’s success in refinancing debt, in securing new credits, and in maintaining public confidence so as to minimize short term capital flight. To date the Padilla government has not performed effectively in any of these three areas. Although we continue to believe the government has a reasonable chance of muddling through financially until elections, a continuing build-up of arrearages on official debt is possible if credit negotiations are not brought to a successful conclusion, and if creditors ultimately balk at rolling over a major portion of the debt service payments due this year. End summary.\n1978 Results. The most recent estimates of Bolivia’s 1978 balance of payments performance, prepared by the Central Bank February 22, 1979, are summarized below:\n\n\n\n\n\n1977\n1978\nPercent Change\n\n\n\n\nCURRENT ACCOUNT\n\n\n\n\n\nA. Exports (FOB)\n649\n641.7\n(1.1)\n\n\nB. Imports (FOB)\n(644)\n(791.9)\n23\n\n\nC. Services\n(188)\n(261.9)\n39.3\n\n\nD. Transfers\n15\n27\n\n\n\nE. Balance\n(168)\n(385.1)\n\n\n\nCAPITAL ACCOUNT\n\n\n\n\n\nA. Long Term Capital (Net)\n335\n294.1\n\n\n\nB. Short Term Capital (Net)\n(96)\n1.6\n\n\n\nC. Balance\n239\n295.7\n\n\n\nD. Errors and Omissions\n(39)\n(33.9)\n\n\n\nE. Net Balance\n32\n(123.3)\n\n\n\n\n(Note: Figures in parentheses are negative.) The net short term capital balance is somewhat misleading. According to the Central Bank, public enterprises received $97 million in short term credits in 1978, and the private sector absorbed another $50 million in short term loans. These credits offset short term outflows of $145.5 million.\n\nMinerals and Hydrocarbons Exports. We estimate that mineral and hydrocarbons exports in 1979 will vary little from levels attained last year. Increased sales of gas to Argentina will bring $15.99 million in additional revenues, but petroleum exports are expected to decline by $37.82 million as production continues to fall and domestic consumption increases. The following are our projections of 1979 mineral and hydrocarbons exports, together with actual exports for 1978.\n\n(ALL AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS OF $ US)\n\n\n\nCommodity\nExports-1978 (FOB)\nExports-1979 (FOB)\n\n\n\n\nTIN\n\n\n\n\nMetallic\n191.77\n211.19\n\n\nConcentrate\n138.6\n122.84\n\n\nAlloy\n5.39\n6.37\n\n\nANTIMONY\n\n\n\n\nMetallic\n4.92\n4.26\n\n\nConcentrate\n12.13\n9.38\n\n\nZINC\n5.18\n6.00\n\n\nTUNGSTEN\n34.81\n25.98\n\n\nCOPPER\n2.52\n4.90\n\n\nLEAD\n7.78\n8.61\n\n\nSILVER\n22.25\n22.34\n\n\nOTHERS\n1.58\n1.76\n\n\nTOTAL MINERALS\n426.93\n423.63\n\n\nNATURAL GAS\n78.51\n94.50\n\n\nPETROLEUM\n42.32\n4.50\n\n\nLIQUID GAS\n1.31\n1.32\n\n\nGASOLINE\n0\n17.0\n\n\nTOTAL HYDROCARBONS\n122.14\n117.32\n\n\nTOTAL MINERALS AND HYDROCARBONS\n549.07\n540.95\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1979LAPAZ02299\nDate: March 15, 1979\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 jan 1960\nConcepts: CERP, ECONOMIC REPORTS, ECONOMIC DATA"

CHIEF OF DELEGATION WILL BE GUSTAVO MEDEIROS QUERJAZU, EX-FOREIGN MINISTER AND CURRENTLY A MEMBER OF GOB’S MARITIME COMMISSION. IN LIKELY EVENT THAT MEDEIROS DOES NOT REMAIN IN CARACAS FOR ENTIRE CONFERENCE, ALTER- NATE CHIEF OF DELEGATION: DR. FELIPE TREDINNICK ABASTO, WILL HEAD BOLIVIAN TEAM. TREDINNICK ASSUMED POST AS DIRECTOR OF LOS DEPARTMENT OF FOREIGN MINISTRY IN APRIL AND IS BOLIVIA’S LEADING EXPERT ON TECHNICAL QUESTIONS INVOLVING LAW OF THE SEA. OTHER MEMBERS OF BOLIVIA’S FIVE-MAN DELEGATION ARE SERGIO PALACIOS, MANUEL FRONTAURA ARGANDONA AND VICTRO TORRES ACHA. ALL MEMBERS OF DELEGATION HOLD PERSONAL RANK OF AMBASSADOR EXCEPT TORRES, WHO AS SECRETARY-GENERAL OF DELEGATION\n\n01 OF 02 010309Z\nWILL HOLD TITLE OF MINISTER-COUNDELOR.\n\nFOLLOWING BIOGRAPHIC DATA ARE PROVIDED ON MEMBERS OF BOLIVIAN DELEGATION. DELEGATION CHIEF MEDEIROS IS ONE OF BOLIVIA’S MOST DISTINGUISHED FORMER DIPLOMATS, HAVING SERVED IN A VARIETY OF DIPLOMATIC ASSIGNEMENTS FROM 1938-1952, AND AGAIN FROM 1964 TO 1969. BORN INTO A PROMINENT SUCRE FAMILY ON OCTOBER 15, 1913, MEDEIROS SUBSEQUENTLY OBTAINED HIS LAW DEGREE IN LOCAL UNIVERSITY AND THEN DID POST-GRADUATE WORK IN ARGENTINA BEFORE EMBARKING ON HIS DIPLOMATIC CAREER. FROM 1938 TO 1952 HE SERVED IN VARYING CAPACITIES WITHIN THE FOREIGN MINISTRY AND IN BUENOS AIRES, SANTIAGO, PARIS, RIO DE JANEIRO, THE UNITED NATIONS, GENEVA AND UNESCO. HIS LAST POST DURING THIS PHASE OF HIS DIPLOMATIC LIFE WAS AS DIRECTOR OF POLITICAL DEPARTMENT OF FOREIGN MINISTRY. MEDEIROS RETIRED INTO PRIVATE LIFE DURING ENTIRE PERIOD OF MNR’S RULE IN BOLIVIA (1952-64), SERVING AS PROFESSOR OF CIVIL LAW AT UNIVERSITY OF SUCRE, PRESIDENT OF NATIONAL BANK OF BOLIVIA, LEGAL ADVISOR TO SUPREME COURT AND VICE RECTOR OF UNIVERSITY OF SUCRE. FOLLOWING FALL OF MNR, HE HEADED BOLIVIAN DELEGATION TO UNITED NATIONS, WAS NAMED AMBASSADOR TO ARGENTINA IN MARCH 1965, AND SUBSEQUENTLY RETURNED TO WORK IN FOREIGN MINISTRY FROM NOVEMBER 1968 UNTIL HIS APPOINTMENT AS FOREIGN MINISTER BY PRESIDENT SILES SALINAS ON MAY 5, 1969. MEDEIROS, A MEMBER OF PRESIDENT’S MODERATELY RIGHT-WING SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY, HELD THIS POST UNTIL OVERTHROW OF SILES IN SEPTEMBER 1969 WHEN HE AGAIN RETIRED INTO PRIVATE LIFE. MEDEIROS SPEAKS FRENCH AND PORTUGUESE, BUT IS NOT BELIEVED TO SPEAK ENGLISH. FURTHER DETAILS ON HIS CAREER MAY BE FOUND IN EMBASSY FS-405 REPORT OF MAY 16,\nIN EMBASSY’S VIEW, MEDEIROS’ CHIEF ROLE AT CARACAS IS LIKELY TO BE THAT OF A DISTINGUISHED FIGUREHEAD, AND HE IS UNLIKELY TO BE PRESENT THROUGH ENTIRE TWO-MONTH CONFERENCE. MEDEIROS’ LONG ABSENCE FROM ACTIVE DIPLOMACY AND HIS PERSONAL LACK OF FAMILIARITY WITH LOS ISSUES WILL FORCE HIM TO RELY HEAVILY ON TREDINNICK, WHO WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY PROVE TO BE LEADING BOLIVIAN NEGOTIATOR ON KEY POINTS AT ISSUE.\nFELIPE TREDINNICK WAS BORN ON NOVEMBER 30, 1930 OF A BOLIVIAN MOTHER AND AN ENGLISH FATHER. HE HOLDS LAW DEGREE FROM UNIVERSITY OF BRAZIL AND DOCTORATE IN INTERNATIONAL LAW FROM UNIVERSITY OF MADRID. HE CURRENTLY IS PLANNING TO PUBLISH\n\n01 OF 02 010309Z\nHIS 500-PAGE DOCTORAL THESIS: “LAW OF THE SEA AND MARITIME FRONTIERS,” IN SPAIN DURING 1975. TREDINNICK’S PREVIOUS KIPLO- MATIC POSTS SINCE JOINING THE FOREIGN MINISTRY IN 1964 HAVE IN- CLUDED MINISTER-COUNSELOR IN BRASILIA AND MADRID, CHIEF OF DELE- GATION TO 1974 LANDLOCKED NATIONS CONFERENCE IN KAMPALA AND CHIEF OF DELEGATION TO GROUP OF 77 LOS CONFERENCE IN NAIROBI. HE IS ALSO A PROFESSOR OF INTERNATIONAL LAW AT SAN ANDRES UNIVERSITY IN LA PAZ, AND ATTENDS CLASSES AT PRESTIGIOUS SCHOOL OF HIGHER\nMILITARY STUDIES. TREDINNICK IS FORMER MEMBER OF FSB AND WAS EXILED TO BRAZIL BY MNR FROM EARLY 1950’S TO 1964 FOR HIS POLITICAL VIEWS; HE IS STILL PRO-FSB AND VIOLENTLY ANTI-MNR IN HIS POLITICS. HE SPEAKS PORTUGUESE AND A SMALL AMOUNT OF ENGLISH.\n\nIN RECENT EXTENSIVE CONTACTS WITH TREDINNICK, EMBASSY OFFICERS HAVE FOUND HIM TO BE SERIOUS, DEDICATED OFFICIAL WITH WIDE KNOWLEDGE OF LOS ISSUES. HE HAS BEEN OPEN AND FRIENDLY IN ALL OF THESE CONTACTS, AND APPEARS TO HAVE HIGHLY FAVORABLE ORIENTATION TOWARD UNITED STATES. TREDINNICK STATES THAT MANY OF HIS FAMILY RELATIVES LIVE IN US, WHERE THEY HOLD ANNUAL REUNION IN WILKES-BARRE, PENNSYLVANIA; HE HIMSELF EXPRESSES GREAT INTEREST IN POSSI- BILITY OF VISITING US AT EARLIEST OPPORTUNITY. TREDINNICK’S ATTITUDES TOWARD BRAZIL ALSO QUITE FAVORABLE, IN VIEW OF FACT THAT HIS WIFE IS BRAZILIAN; HE ALSO FEELS FROM HIS OWN EXPERIENCE IN BRAZIL THAT BRAZILIANS MAKE GOOD DIPLOMATS AND ARE FLEXIBLE ENOUGH TO MAKE NEGOTIATION POSSIBLE OVER POINTS OF DIFFERENCE. FROM HIS RECENT EXPERIENCES AT KAMPALA AND NAIROBI, TREDINNICK CARRIED AWAY STRONGLY NEGATIVE RE- ACTION TO PERUVIAN AND CHILEAN DIPLOMATS, WHOM HE CHARACTERIZES AS LACKING ANY BARGAINING FLEXIBILITY AND FREEDOM TO NEGOTIATE.

Caiola believes that the Central Bank’s reserve position is sufficiently good, providing recent credits from Latin American Central Banks are rolled over, for such a schedule to be feasible. End summary.\nMarcelo Caiola, the leader of the IMF team currently negotiating with the GOB, and Jorge Sol Perez, the Fund’s local representative, briefed me Friday afternoon on the current state of the negotiations. Caiola indicated that the negotiations were proceeding well, although they were slowed somewhat by difficulties in obtaining some key data. The appointment this week of Jose Justiniano as Central Bank President is viewed by Caiola as a very positive development.\nThe present schedule is for Caiola to assemble his analysis and recommendations by September 26 so that they can be discussed by GOB and Fund officials during the IMF/IBRD annual meeting in Belgrade. Agreement on the steps to be taken by the GOB should be reached at the meeting or shortly thereafter. The GOB will then begin to implement the measures, especially those concerning the exchange rate, during November. Caiola will prepare his documentation and submit it to the IMF Board at that time. The Board should take action by December 15.\nThe financial package Caiola has in mind would include: (A) an Extended Fund Facility drawing of $240 to $280 million disbursed as follows—25 percent in December 1979, 50 percent in calendar 1980 and 25 percent in calendar 1981; (B) a credit of about $250 million probably over five years with two years grace from a syndicate led by Citibank to cover $200 million owed to commercial banks with a little extra for the Central Bank’s reserves; (C) a $30 to $40 million loan by the Fundo Andino; and (D) possibly a $30 to $40 million program loan from the IBRD.\nAlthough the Central Bank’s reserve position continues to weaken, Caiola is confident that with the rollover for 180 days of the $140 million borrowed recently (for 90 days) from the Central Banks of Argentina, Brazil and Venezuela, the drawdown of $50 million lines of credit with commercial banks which the GOB has not yet touched, and a tight credit policy, the timetable outlined in paragraph 5 will be feasible.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1979LAPAZ07871\nDate: September 15, 1979\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 20 Mar 2014\nConcepts: NEGOTIATIONS, FINANCIAL AGREEMENTS"

END SUMMARY.\n        \n            \n    \n    \n  \n\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE TELEGRAM\nUNCLASSIFIED\n\nPresident had clear idea of topics he wished to cover and did most of talking in one-half hour interview. He began by explaining that the days of Congressman’s visit were unusual because Bolivia experiencing serious food shortages and political scene was agitated. He related shortages and long lines seen in city to world-wide food crisis. He gave lengthy explanation of political problem stating that after several years of instability Bolivians generally agreed on need for national unity. For that reason Government, including military and two major parties, formed in 1971 and he recently seeking to broaden political base even further by including smaller groups. While most of MNR agreed with this concept, unfortunately Victor Paz did not and sought merely to strengthen his party for 1975 elections. He and small group of associates thus had to be expelled.\nPresident asserted that Bolivia’s economic prospects are good. It has excellent resources in energy, minerals and agriculture and must take advantage of favorable world price situation, which he expects to continue for some years. President said he is confident that with help of contracts with U.S. oil companies, large hydro-carbon deposits will be found. He gave special emphasis to Bolivia’s hydroelectric possibilities which he thought may allow it even to export electricity in future years. He reiterated that economic development requires stability and national unity.\nPresident gave high praise to U.S. economic assistance rendered during his time in office. Both PADES and Emergency Plan have had beneficial social effects. He made special mention of community development assistance which has “changed mentality of campesinos.” As example, he said that in contrast to past, campesinos now arrive with one-half funds in hand and only ask Government grant for other half. In future, Government considering loaning its half on very long terms to encourage this mentality.\nRegarding U.S. military assistance, President recalled that he had been encouraged when Ambassador Siracusa had told him that program would be raised from approximate average annual level of US$ one million to US$ four million. U.S. and Bolivian personnel had then drawn up plan for expenditures. President said he is disappointed that plan is not repeat not progressing better. Lack of progress had caused Government to make costly expenditures on its own. New equipment, he explained, is necessary for military morale and for internal “persuasive force” that Bolivia is building up to discourage extremists. “When Communists see that the military force is strong,” he said, “they remain outside country.” Congressman Whalen replied indicating that some in U.S. Congress reluctant to appropriate funds for use for internal security forces, but he wished to study problem raised by President.\nAs final item, President called attention Bolivia’s new narcotics law, a GOB’s determination to fight problem. President said he does not like to see children of friend being hurt by product produced in Bolivia. He said that Bolivia would need assistance and asked Congressman’s support. Speaking for himself, Mr. Whalen opined that Congress would not hesitate to help worthwhile efforts to stop drug traffic.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1974LAPAZ00206\nDate: January 10, 1974\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 JAN 1960\nConcepts: n/a"

The law has been promulgated and it establishes the framework and provides the authorization for a Bolivian narcotics control entity capable of dealing with all aspects of the narcotics problem. However, until the GOB approves funding for this entity it will not come into being, which means that the only narcotics control activity in Bolivia for the remainder of FY 1974 will be that of Major Lopez’ police unit against manufacturers and traffickers of cocaine.\nThe drafting commission of the law should continue in being, as the only nucleus of expertise on narcotics matters in Bolivia, in order to establish the basic working norms of the various components of the new entity; to travel to the departmental capitals of the country to conduct seminars on the law for local authorities; to act as the original management of the new entity, prepare its budget, select its staff, and generally get it into operation.\nThis essential activity was not foreseen in preparing the FY 1974 NCAP budget. The additional amount requested includes bonuses for seven officials plus one secretary (total of $5,000 for 5 months beginning February 1 through June 30), travel and per diem expense ($5,000), publicity and communications expense ($2,000), office equipment ($2,000), miscellaneous expenses ($1,000).\nApproval of funds to keep the Bolivian members of the narcotics law drafting committee working together on the narcotics problem will maintain the momentum behind the narcotics effort and prevent progress to date from being dissipated through lack of attention. Committee head is Sub-Secretary of Justice Gaston Ledesma who is favorably known in Department.\nWould appreciate early decision as group still standing by ready to carry out mission, but may begin to break up soon if lack of sufficient funds leaves it with nothing to do for next few months.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1974LAPAZ00963\nDate: February 13, 1974\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 JAN 1960\nConcepts: DRUG CONTROL, BUDGETS, PERSONNEL TRAINING, FUND ALLOTMENT, DRUG TRAFFIC, POLICE FORCES"

In 1980, however, Bolivia’s debt service burden will be unsustainable without stabilization measures. The GOB is now studying the IMF proposed stabilization program and is likely to make some counterproposals, some of which Sol Perez has not yet communicated to the IMF headquarters in Washington. The GOB opposes a managed float preferring instead a one-step devaluation with a dual exchange system to lessen the social impact. The GOB realizes that the IMF will be reluctant to support such a plan with Extended Fund Facility (EFF) financing. Sol Perez expects the GOB to request the US to persuade the IMF to accept its proposals. (Note: Sol Perez has acquired this information through informal discussions with GOB officials and he enjoined us in the strongest terms from revealing to others–especially IMF headquarters or the GOB–that we are aware of it.) End Summary.\n\nBolivia’s Debt Service Burden\n\nThe GOB had obligations to repay $142.2 million in short-term loans to foreign central banks and commercial banks between July 1979 and January 1980. (These credits from central banks are not really swaps but rather time deposits at rates of interest ranging from 9.9 to over 11 percent.) The GOB has repaid $10.7 million of these obligations recently. The remaining $131.5 were refinanced for six months and therefore are due between January 1980 and July 1980.\nIn addition, on the way back from the NAM meeting, GOB Foreign Minister Fernandez stopped in Caracas and obtained $43 million more from Venezuela. The GOB has drawn $20 million of this and has $23 million more at its disposal. The terms are six months at 15 percent. GOB also line up $10 million from the Andean Fund (CAF) for three months at 15 percent and has drawn this down. At the Belgrade IMF/IBRD Annual Meeting (or more likely, the Latin American preparatory meeting in Madrid), the GOB obtained a $20 million line of credit from Spain, presumably also for six months, which it has not yet drawn.\nTherefore, the GOB has obligations to repay $161.5 million in short-term debts during the first half of 1980. Moreover, if it draws the additional $23 million from Venezuela and $20 million from Spain before the end of 1979, the total principal to repay by mid-1980 will be $204.5 million. Venezuela has the greatest exposure–about $83 million of these short-term obligations. Deutsch Sudamerikanish Bank has about $39 million and Bankers Trust about $10 million.\nAccording to Sol Perez, Bolivia’s contracted medium and long-term public debt with foreign commercial banks totals $500 million.\nPayments on Bolivia’s total medium and long-term public foreign debt (with public and private creditors) will amount to $301 million in principal, interest and commissions during 1980. Payments to foreign commercial banks comprise one-half, or $150 million, of this. Thus, total debt service payments in 1980 are likely to total more than $462.5 million–$161.5 in principal on short-term obligations to central banks (interest will be additional) and $301.0 million for medium and long-term debt– and could exceed $500 million.\nThe IMF estimates that $462 million represents 51 percent of Bolivia’s projected exports (FOB) in 1980. Since Bolivia’s receipts for non-factor services are minimal, this will give Bolivia a debt service ratio in 1980 of approximately 50 percent.\n\nBolivia’s Reserve Position\n\nThe Central Bank’s gross reserves are now about $150 million. Of this $40-50 million is in non-liquid assets–mostly gold. The $110-100 million remaining consists entirely of “depositores de terceros,” i.e., deposits of state enterprises, and reserve deposits of commercial banks. According to Sol Perez, the Central Bank is playing a dangerous game because the possible combination of large withdrawals by state enterprises (COMIBOL, YPFB or ENAF) plus an increase in purchases of foreign exchange by the Bolivian public could consume this $100-110 million rapidly and force the Central Bank to institute foreign exchange controls or halt sales altogether.\nSol Perez believes the GOB can survive until the end of December (if all goes well) because the 500 percent prior-deposit decree has reduced average net daily foreign exchange losses from about $3 million to $1.5 million. Therefore, losses for November and December are likely to total about $90 million. The Central Bank should be able to sustain this with the $43 million in unused credit from Venezuela and Spain and the $50 million in unused lines from New York commercial banks.\n\nStatus of GOB-IMF Negotiations\n\nAs reported previously, the IMF’s proposed package for Bolivia comprises several basic measures:\n\n\nIncrease hydrocarbon prices by 130 percent;\nRationalize the GOB investment budget;\nRefinance foreign commercial debt and limit new foreign borrowing (the IMF has recommended refinancing at this time only $230 million.

Tom, on another subject, what does the United States think of the direction in which things are moving in Bolivia?\nA. Where?\nQ. Bolivia – it’s a country –\nQ. Land-locked Bolivia. (LAUGHTER)\nA. Yes. I do have something I want to say about this. The forced change of government, of course, was by non-constitutional means, and last night’s closing of the Congress was further disruption of the constitutional process. I said yesterday that we would deplore any disruption of the constitutional process there, and I stand on that. It is regrettable that this major step backwards occurred in the Bolivian people’s heartening advance during the last two years toward representative government and respect for human rights.\nQ. You alluded yesterday to a review of US-Bolivian relations if the coup in fact succeeded. Can you say that without qualification today?\nA. Oh, yes, I can say that without qualification. That review continues; but on the basis of what we learned yesterday and what apparently has taken place on the ground, I want to announce that in response to the situation there the United States has suspended its assistance programs with Bolivia. We will continue to review all aspects of our relations.\nQ. What was the size of that assistance program?\nA. Military assistance recently has been running at approximately $6 million per year; planned development assistance for fiscal year 1980, including Food for Peace, is approximately $50 million. Out of that $50 million, the Food for Peace amount is $28.5 million.\nQ. You’re not suspending that, are you?\nA. I have got an expert in the back there. Are we suspending the total $50 million?\nMr. Taylor: Yes. Mr. Reston: We are suspending – including the Food for Peace. It has all been suspended.\nQ. Is the Ambassador expected to come home?\nA. No. Paul Boeker is going to remain on the scene to report about the evolving situation.\nQ. What is his last name?\nA. B-O-E-K-E-R is his last name.\nQ. What is his first name, Paul?\nA. Paul.\nQ. In other words, the US action appears to mean that you have now made up your mind about this regime, you don’t like it, and you are going to do what you can to discourage it.\nA. I said that we deplore it; we regret it. We continue to review the totality of our relationship with Bolivia; and on the basis of what we learned yesterday about what has taken place, we have taken the concrete actions which I have just announced.\nQ. Why are you cutting the Food for Peace, which goes to needy people?\nA. The question?\nA. The question is, why are we cutting the Food for Peace program? I think I have suggested the reasons which lie behind the announcement which I have just made.\nQ. In view of this famous luncheon on October 23 at the Embassy, to which this Colonel Natusch was invited but didn’t go, does the Secretary consider this as not only a setback for US policy but to his own prestige?\nA. I think what I want to say about that lunch which we had down there is that the United States does not pretend to control events in every other country in the world.\nQ. That’s for sure. (LAUGHTER)\nA. At that lunch, the Secretary made the views of the United States known to those at the luncheon. We have stated our deep concern over the departure from constitutional processes, but it is the Bolivians themselves, in the last analysis, who will decide what happens in their country.\nQ. Let me follow that up? The American Secretary of State, at the American Embassy, invites four former Presidents, all the Army chiefs, and talks about democracy, and about a week later there is a coup. Is this a setback for US policy and for the Secretary personally?\nA. I think what it really – I think the tone of my statement would indicate that we perhaps believe it is a setback for constitutional processes in Bolivia.\nQ. Tom, can you tell us whether we have talked to any other Latin American governments about this or are we attempting to coordinate activities in order to bring pressure on Bolivia?\nA. I think I took that question yesterday, but I didn’t get an answer to it. I’ll check again, today.\nQ. Tom, do you know what the timing would be on the aid cutoff – like would weapons shipments be stopped or training programs be terminated? Or is there something you could reverse if events down there changed in a fairly short time?\nA. What I show here is the suspension of these programs, and I assume that that means that they will be frozen.\nQ. Tom, could I just follow up on that and one other question?\nA. Yes.\nQ. When you talk about this total of $56 million, has any part of that already gone down? Are we talking about the entire $56 million being suspended or has most of it already –\nA. It’s $50 million.\nQ. It’s $50 million plus $6 million military, right?\nA. Oh, yes. I’m sorry. You’re absolutely right.\nQ. How much is Food for Peace?\nA. $28.5 is Food for Peace, economic assistance is $50 million, military is –\nQ. What about –\nQ. Wait a minute. Let’s get the answer first.\nA. The $50 million is planned development assistance for fiscal year ’80, which began October 1 of this year. I will take the question as to what amount has already been sent down there, what amount is in the pipeline, and what amount remains to be sent.\nQ. And, of course, military is what?\nA. I will get a precise figure for fiscal year ’80 and will break it out in the same manner.\nQ. Do you have last year’s?\nQ. Then, I just wanted to ask another question: Yesterday, I believe you were under the impression that this Colonel was of the right-wing persuasion, but there have also been stories that –\nA. I didn’t say anything about him.\nQ. I’m sorry. Well, maybe I saw that somewhere else. Does the State Department have any evaluation yet of where on the political spectrum this gentleman stands?\nA. I have some biographical information about him; I don’t have anything to offer about his ideological persuasions except from his actions. He obviously has a particular view of politics.\nQ. Not a convicted democrat. (LAUGHTER)\nA. Do you want the biographical information?\nQ. No, but what I would like, though, is some sense of the whole – and I’d appreciate it if you would take the question – not just of his ideological persuasion, but who the forces are behind him. Do you have any sense of that?\nA. Well, let’s see what I can get for you on that.\nQ. Do you know if Bolivia receives Development Bank assistance, and if so, will the United States act in those forums to cut aid to Bolivia, which is where it counts, usually?\nA. I’ll take that question.\nQ. I wondered if pipeline aid was also being suspended – in other words, ships at sea, are they being turned back?\nA. We’ll try to find the answer to that question.\nQ. Stuff in the FY ’79 budget, sometimes that stuff, you know, even though the year is ended, is still on the way.\nA. I’ve said that we are suspending our aid here. We are not going to make up our minds about these things depending on which fiscal year the budgetary cycle is in. I will take the question about whether stuff which is on its way is going down there, but I don’t think we are going to make up our minds about this as to whether it was done before or after October 1.\nQ. Is your announcement here the first word to them or have they been formally notified through the Embassy?\nA. We have formally notified them through the Embassy.\nQ. Tom, you pushed aside what I think was a very legitimate question a couple of minutes ago. It has often been our practice in the past, for example, in dealing with the Somoza government in Nicaragua, not to suspend what we call humanitarian aid that benefited the people of a country. We have expressed a lot of concern about famine in other parts of the world despite our disapproval of governments there. Why is it that we are including Food for Peace and other humanitarian programs in this suspension?\nA. Let me take that question and see if I can get you a more elaborate rationale beyond what has obviously happened in the last 24 hours.\nQ. Do you consider this government consolidated already?\nA. The situation last night in Bolivia appeared to be calm. There does not seem to be active military opposition to the new Bolivian regime. There does, however, seem to be some opposition among civilian groups. Ex-President Paz Estenssoro, the leader of the National Revolutionary Movement, has expressed his opposition as have several other leading political figures and organizations in Bolivia, including former President and Commander of the Armed Forces General David Padilla, and including the principal labor leadership in Bolivia.\nQ. Tom, a follow up?\nA. Yes, go ahead and follow up.\nQ. Democracy in Bolivia was installed in a regional context in which many countries were supporting this process. Why aren’t you able to tell us what kind of contacts you are having with the Andean countries and is there any role for the coup by Brazil and Argentina?\nA. Is there any role for the coup?\nQ. Yes. Did Argentina and Brazil play any role supporting the coup?\nA. I have nothing about purported roles by Argentina or Brazil. As to your other question about, have we been in touch with the Andean Pact, I don’t see any reason why we shouldn’t be able to provide that answer to you, and I would hope that the bureaucratic wheels would start to turn and get an answer to your very legitimate question.\nQ. Tom, I know you do not deal with questions of recognition of changes of government, but in view of the fact that there is substantial special civilian opposition, including former President Guevara meeting with a rump session of the National Assembly, do you now recognize Colonel Natusch as the head of the government of Bolivia? Or are you considering that judgment not to be makeable at this point?\nA. I can’t make that judgment from this podium here. I think we have our Ambassador on the ground there, who is reporting on what is very clearly an evolving situation. We are reviewing the totality of our relationships with Bolivia, and that means as well, obviously, we are reviewing the nature of our diplomatic relationship with Bolivia.\nQ. Tom, do you have anything for comparative purposes of what aid actually went to Bolivia last year?\nA. I can get that for you, sure. Q. Tom, you mentioned that Argentina and Brazil are not involved. What about Chile?\nA. I mentioned that Argentina and –\nQ. And Brazil that there is no apparent role.\nA. I said that I didn’t have anything to offer about that.\nQ. What about Chile?\nA. I really have nothing that I can offer on the nature of the Chilean relationship, if any.\nQ. You said that you were examining the nature of our diplomatic relations with Bolivia?\nA. I said, yesterday, that we were reviewing the totality of our relationship with Bolivia –\nQ. Yes, but we specifically –\nA. – and “totality” obviously would include everything, including diplomatic –\nQ. Wait a minute, don’t go away –\nA. Oh, I am going to have to go away pretty soon, as a matter of fact.\nQ. Yes, I know. Yesterday, we excluded diplomatic because your policy used to be that you don’t recognize governments, you recognize countries.\nA. Yes.\nQ. Is there a question whether – is there a possibility you are saying the United States is considering whether or not to maintain diplomatic relations with Bolivia? Is that what you are saying?\nA. I would not want you to write that, frankly, I don’t think that is very –\nQ. Well, would they –\nA. I don’t think that is where I am trying to take you here.\nQ. But you said you were reviewing it.\nA. I said we were reviewing our relationship with Bolivia in light of the developments which have taken place there over the last 36 hours or so.\nQ. That is not what you said yesterday.\nA. Yes, that’s what I said yesterday.\nQ. Today you said “diplomatic relationships.”\nA. Then I was asked the question: “Well, what does that mean? How much of your relationship?” And I said we were reviewing the totality of our relationship.\nQ. Right.\nA. Now, diplomatic relations can involve a great many things. I was asked the question earlier in the briefing today as to whether we were going to recall our Ambassador there. I said, no, we’re not going to recall our Ambassador there. That is part of diplomatic relations. We are going to leave the Ambassador there to report on the situation as it developed. I have nothing to offer you.\nQ. O.K.\nA. Absolutely nothing, one way or the other, about the status or our present diplomatic relations with Bolivia.\nQ. Well, you probably want to stay on Bolivia for a while, don’t you?\nA. I don’t, but they do. (LAUGHTER)\nQ. Tom, do you have any information whether any part of the Bolivian Armed Forces are in touch with the civilian opposition to this coup? In other words, is there some hope of reversal here, or what?\nA. I really can’t answer that question because I don’t know the answer. But I have a more official posture to put on it, which is that I know of no military unit in the country which is in opposition at the present time –\nQ. Except the Commander-in-Chief.\nA. – to the Colonel’s people.\nQ. Tom, you took the question about talks with Andean countries. If, when checking, you discovered that the United States has not consulted with Argentina and Brazil, would this indicate that you are thinking that these two countries are playing with the coup?\nA. No, I don’t think so. But I will try to check and see whether we have been in touch with the others, as well, about it. We have done a good deal of work over recent months with members of the Andean Pact qua Andean Pact. We worked closely with them to try to help resolve the Nicaraguan situation. The Secretary was in Quito for the installation of the new Ecuadorean President, and he met with the Andean Pact as members of the Andean Pact then. Again at the OAS meeting, we met with them as members of the Andean Pact. Therefore, it seems to me logical in that framework, that we would have been consulting with members of the Andean Pact about what has happened within one of their own countries.\nQ. Tom, General Banzer was the other man who didn’t come to lunch last week, I gather. Do you regard him as being involved or behind this coup?\nA. I really don’t have anything to offer on that.\nQ. Can you take that question?\nA. Yes, let me find out what we think the General is up to.\nQ. By taking this drastic action, including suspension of food aid – a step which has not even taken with respect to Cambodia where a holocaust is going on – are you trying to promote the restoration of civilian rule? Are you trying to undercut this government?\nA. Who runs Bolivia is a matter for the Bolivians to decide. We do not control that. But we, like Bolivia, are a sovereign nation: and we have the right to take actions which are within our control.\nQ. That doesn’t answer the question. What is your ultimate objective by taking this drastic action?\nA. I don’t want to stand here and give you a tote list of what the ultimate objectives of the United States are. When the Secretary was in La Paz, he made very, very clear to the Bolivians the preference of the United States for democratic processes.\nQ. Tom, let me follow that up, please. That’s a general question. Can you recall any other time when the US has cut off food – aid – when it was suspended?\nQ. Chile.\nQ. When this administration has done it.\nA. I will take that question.\nQ. Yes, in fact it might help if you could, if you listed instances, because I know there have been precedents – but I don’t know which countries. They were small countries.\nA. I will take the question.\nQ. Yes, I want to follow up with this question: When you were listing the times recently when you have dealt with the Andean Pact as the Andean Pact, they have tended to be times when the Andean Pact has not followed the preferable US policy in given situations. I would like to ask a philosophical question: If the new government indeed is oriented along the lines of, for instance, Argentina, do you think that they would play a role in tending to be more supportive of the kind of initiatives that the Andean Pact has rebuffed that Secretary Vance made in the instances you mentioned?\nA. Oh, Laura, I think that is a speculative question.\nQ. I can rephrase it less diplomatically.\nA. I am sure you can, Laura.\nQ. Tom, I would like to ask you a couple of questions about Cuba.\nQ. Still on Bolivia – can you say whether any US officials are meeting or talking with members of the former Guevara government or other opponents of the coup in Bolivia, and are encouraging them to take some steps to restore the democratic processes there?\nA. I think you can assume that Ambassador Boeker and his staff at the Embassy in La Paz are in touch with a number of Bolivian political figures to discuss with them the situation. I am not going to detail for you what the Ambassador and his staff precisely might be saying.\nQ. Opposition? Including the opposition?\nA. A number of Bolivian political leaders.\nQ. Tom, there is one inconsistency here that I just can’t reconcile in my mind. You describe this as an evolving situation. You have got the Ambassador talking to opposition political figures. And yet you have taken such a decisive act as to cut off, or suspend all aid. Doesn’t that decision imply that you regard this as pretty much a fait accompli? I don’t see how it can be evolving and while it is evolving you take such a decisive step.\nA. I don’t necessarily see any inconsistency in that.\nQ. Well, let’s put it this way: do you see this action as being a factor in the evolution of the situation?\nA. Well, we will see about that, won’t we? Because –\nQ. Is it the contention of this government that it should be a factor in the evolution of the situation?\nA. I think that you are just going to have to use your own judgment on that. And as to whether it will turn out to be a factor, that is something that only the future will tell.\nSubsequent to the above verbatim exchange, the Department posted a correction as to which economic assistance was being suspended.\nA. The correction is as follows: We are suspending military and economic assistance while we follow developments in Bolivia and review our programs in the light of the developments. We do not intend to suspend, or cut off, Title II PL 480 or other humanitarian assistance.\nB. At the same time this correction was posted, the press was given the following breakdown of economic assistance:\n\n\n\n\nFY 1979\nFY 1980\n\n\n\n\nDevelopment Assistance Loans\n$20.0 Million\n$14.0 Million\n\n\nDevelopment Assistance Grants\n8.9\n7.1\n\n\nFood for Peace Title I\n9.2\n11.2\n\n\nFood for Peace Title III\n12.0\n17.3\n\n\nTotals\n$50.1 Million\n$49.6 Million\n\n\n\nC.

While human rights and the electoral process have thus far fared well, the Padilla regime has in the meantime mired itself down in a shabby display of infectious venality and incompetence that has tarnished its image and raised some doubts about its ability to carry forward its well-advertised objectives for Bolivia’s democratization.\nWhen B/Gen Padilla executed his overthrow of the Pereda regime almost four months ago, a certain euphoria permeated La Paz’ notably rarefied air, emanating mainly from among some of the generationalist officers who constituted the underpinnings of the coup. The immediate tension reliever, of course, was the announcement of elections for July 1979 (instead of May 1980), a move which provided a kind of moral justification for the takeover as well as a mandate for constitutionalism which few could challenge. Utterances of reform, elimination of corruption, a restructuring of the government (and public sector corporations in particular) were heard in loose, uncoordinated statements to the press. The prisoners implicated in the previous months coup plotting were released, and the regime appeared off to a good start in both word and deed.\nExactly who was in charge was not clear. For a time it appeared that Padilla had ridden the tail of the tiger into power and would ultimately disappear from the scene at the pleasure of the younger officers who had used him as their key instrument. Or was Padilla — nobody’s fool — really using these young and ambitious officers, several of whom had been arrested by him only a month previously for plotting, to propel him into the presidency? More than likely, both scenarios were accurate to a degree in that the plotting and execution of the coup as it unfolded revealed a strange coterie of collaborators — conservative Padilla on the one hand, his generationalist officers on the other — who had nothing really in common except the desire to overthrow the incumbent Pereda regime. Surely their reasons were quite different: Padilla wanted personal power, or in any case to avoid being victimized in an overthrow. The most zealous younger officers wanted power, ostensibly for purposes of reform. To determine which side prevailed is only to review what has transpired since last November; i.e., Padilla has accumulated power and encouraged corruption and incompetence in the process; the influence of his generationalist cabinet has waned; and there has been no reform on any front.\nWhat can be said in Padilla’s behalf is that the election schedule remains firm and that there has been no diminution in the respect for human rights in Bolivia. Indeed, the political process appears to be moving forward as a number of political parties have held conventions, named candidates, and as the government has implemented some significant changes in electoral procedures. One has the clear impression that the Padilla government is sincere in purpose and really means to step down come August 6. Human rights and a democratization process apparently well in train are the two positive entries on the ledger.\nThe negative side of the ledger, however, is bleak with shabby efforts to consolidate power, promote corruption, and burden the civil administration with the appointment of hacks and incompetents in key positions. The problem, of course, is whether ultimately Padilla may not have grabbed another tiger by the tail, i.e., the miring down of his regime in a system of patronage and payoffs involving Bolivia’s Armed Forces to the extent that he loses control in the process so that other powerful and conservative forces — not so willing to give up the game and its rewards — see elections and a new government as a clear threat to their interests.\nCorruption A. We have good information that the Bolivian Armed Forces have been engaged in rather extensive arms purchases, possibly amounting to some $103 million. A source close to the President informs us that Army Deputy G-4 Lt Col Javier Alcoreza is currently involved in some of the arms purchases arrangements. The source voiced his impression that Padilla stands to profit personally in a very substantial way. B. We also know that officers of the Armed Forces of Lt Col or equivalent grade have been accorded an exemption from customs duties for importation of two automobiles each, which in Bolivia could mean a windfall profit from the resale of $15-30,000. This exemption is in addition to the recent influx of illegal automobiles into Bolivia as well as the blatant sale of entry permits for automobiles coming in through Santa Cruz.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1979LAPAZ02023\nDate: March 08, 1979\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 jan 1960\nConcepts: DEMOCRACY, FORM OF GOVERNMENT"

Department may wish refer to Table III Embassy’s A-228 which displays Embassy data on FY basis. Updating that table, FY 1973 commercial imports totalled 123,300 metric tons of wheat equivalent. Embassy calculation based on GOB data contrasts with 138,020 metric tons figure cited reftel.\nComment: EC’s proposed 130,000 metric tons UMR still seems high especially given Bolivian difficulties securing Argentine wheat in first semester FY 1974.

We are planning to invite approximately ten Bolivian couples, though we cannot do so until the new president has been named.\nDepending on outcome, we would invite Bolivian guests from following list, which capsules individuals’ personal history and language ability. We would appreciate comment before selecting and sending invitations.\nJaime Paz Zamora. The UDP’s vice presidential candidate, Paz, 40, is one of the three kingpins of the left-leaning MIR, which is often characterized as Bolivia’s “party of the future.” Paz is bright, articulate and personable–but he does not speak English.\nLuis Ossio Sanjines. The MNR’s vice presidential candidate, Ossio, 47, is a leader of the small but influential Christian Democratic Party. A lawyer with close ties to Bolivia’s private mining sector, he is frank and easily approached. He does not speak English.\nCarlos Iturralde Ballivian. Formerly ambassador to Malaysia and to the United States (1978), Iturralde, 39, is a wealthy mine-owner with close ties to the rightist Hugo Banzer sector.

Until recently Bolivia’s permanent representative to the United Nations, Rolon, 52, was vice presidential candidate on Hugo Banzer’s right-wing ADN ticket. Although a lawyer, writer and educator of broad experience, he is not believed to speak English.\nWalter Guevara Arze: Founder and guiding light of the small, relatively conservative PRA party, Guevara, 67, was elected Senator from Cochabamba on Victor Paz Estenssoro’s MNR ticket. He has served in previous governments as Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ambassador to Israel and France and permanent representative to the United Nations. English is good.\nGuillermo Bedregal Gutierrez. A veteran MNR politician, Bedregal, 52, was elected as a deputy from La Paz on the Paz Estenssoro slate. A lawyer and prolific author on political subjects, he could be appointed Minister of Planning. He does not speak English.\nCarlos Antonio Carrasco. A former Minister of Education, Carrasco, 43, is a model technocrat who until recently was employed by the United Nations in Caracas. Elected to a deputy position from Cochabamba on Hernan Siles’ UDP ticket, he speaks excellent English.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1979LAPAZ06628\nDate: August 02, 1979\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 jan 1960\nConcepts: VISITS, SOCIAL RECEPTIONS"

MINISTERS OF FINANCE AND IND/COM HELD JOINT RADIO/TV INTERVIEW JANUARY 21 AND FINANCE MINISTER AND MINISTER SECRETARY AND MINISTER OF TRANSPORTATION GAVE OTHER RADIO/TV INTERVIEWS JANUARY 22 ATTEMPTING TO ASSURE POPULACE THAT STEPS TAKEN NECESSARY TO ELIMINATE SHORTAGES AND THAT THEY ARE SUFFICIENT AND FURTHER PRICE INCREASES SHOULD NOT BE ANTICIPATED. SUB-SECRETARY OF COMMERCE TOLD EMBOFF THAT HE ESTIMATES FOOD SUPPLIES MUST BE REGULARIZED IN NEXT TEN DAYS OR PUBLIC CONFIDENCE WILL BE LOST AND MEASRES WILL PROVE INEFFECTIVE. END SUMMARY.\n        \n            \n    \n    \n  \n\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE TELEGRAM\nUNCLASSIFIED\n\nSimple explanation given by government for measures, for instance in signs posted throughout city, is that lines (colas) had to be eliminated. Without clear elaboration, press reported that in interviews ministers referred to four problems as cause of government action: contraband and hoarding, overevaluation of neighboring countries’ currencies, national production and imports. Minister Ind/Com Pereda said that country “not an island” but has long border and although government earlier froze prices, world experiencing worst economic crisis since 1930 and forces of inflation have had local effect. Ministers explained that wheat essentially transportation problem but said that sugar in oversupply and rice harvest delayed. They stated that official meat prices will not be raised. Subsequent press notice stressed that a general price increase not permitted and forty-four basic items still controlled at former prices.\nGovernment took pains to emphasize that there will be no devaluation. One of decrees gave guarantee against devaluation for domestic savings. Minfin stated that this year Bolivia will have favorable balance of payments. He admitted that some additional measures, such as reduction of export taxes and import duties and some internal taxes, are being contemplated to stimulate production and ease burden of new bonus on private concerns.\nFor benefit of press Minfin gave detailed breakdown of government’s calculation of $B400 bonus showing that it based on effect of new prices on “market basket” survey done by Factory Workers Federation. He said that ministry concluded that $B254 bonus merited but President Banzer personally ruled that higher amount should be paid. Workers who have more than one source of income or who benefit from subsidized commissary will have to negotiate with employers regarding size of bonus. According to press some firms complaining of inability to pay bonus.\nAlthough no announcement made of new public transportation fares Minfin inferred that 30 percent rise can be expected and we understand that negotiations now underway with drivers. He stated that public transportation subsidy will continue and domestic gasoline prices will not be raised because international prices high enough to support present low domestic gasoline price.\nComment: Initial reaction to measure is one of uncertainty and to some extent confusion caused by GOB’s explanation of measures. As result most storekeepers have shut doors and generally retailers have shown hesitancy in dealing with public. Labor highly concerned about price rises while downplaying benefit of bonus (see septel). An economic slowdown and increased unemployment are probably very bad eventualities unless GOB provides some form of relief, possibly tax concessions, restoration of subsidies to some basic food crops, etc. The subsidy may not be reasonable tool if absolute scarcities prevail and tax concessions may be overly costly to fiscal integrity of GOB.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1974LAPAZ00493\nDate: January 24, 1974\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 JAN 1960\nConcepts: CONTRABAND, DEVALUATIONS, ECONOMIC PROGRAMS, EXPORTS, FOOD SHORTAGE, IMPORTS, PRESS COMMENTS, PRESS"

At the same time, however, he has resisted taking any significant action to shore up the nation’s sagging economy and has allowed corruption in the armed forces and the government to spread unchecked. Against this background, the civilian political groups have been organizing slowly. Siles Zuazo’s UDP coalition, initially plagued by defections and bitter internal dissension over Siles’ choice of the MIR’s Paz Zamora for the vice presidential slot, finally jelled on April 9. Paz Estenssoro, whose electoral alliance was formalized that same date, superficially appears to be in a better position than Siles Zuazo—but Siles, as last year, could prove to be the more effective vote getter. Bernal, who may hold the key to the presidency in the event of a congressional runoff, thus far has concentrated on cultivating the rural vote in Cochabamba and Oruro, while former President Banzer, the odd man out, has publicly announced that he will launch his own presidential bid.\nSince January, President David Padilla has demonstrated shrewd political judgment and, by acting pragmatically, has managed both to strengthen his position in power and to defuse potential threats to the democratization process. Not surprisingly, his first significant challenge came from within his military constituency. From the outset, many questioned whether Padilla would be able to control the headstrong “generationalist” officers who were the architects of the November 24 coup. Most concerned about Padilla’s position were his high-ranked colleagues, many of whom feared that generationalist cabinet ministers Lt. Colonels Rolando Saravia (Agriculture), Victor Ramirez (Labor), and Raul Lopez (Interior) posed a threat to the military’s hierarchical values; some also believed that Saravia and Lopez were “leftists,” ideologically committed to Hernan Siles Zuazo’s UDP.\nWhatever the merits of their case, Padilla accurately gauged the mounting anti-generationalist pressure, and—shortly after detecting an incipient conspiracy by pro-Banzer elements—he moved decisively. Taking advantage of the temporary absence from La Paz of such key ministers as General Jorge Echazu (Mines) and Lt. Col. Gary Prado (Planning), who might have opposed him on purely generational grounds, he squeezed Saravia and Ramirez out of the cabinet, leaving Lopez isolated and somewhat beholden to him. The upshot of this maneuver was that the pro-Banzer plotters were undercut, the senior-ranked officers were mollified, and Padilla’s position vis-a-vis the generationalists was strengthened.\nPadilla has been equally pragmatic in his dealings with the civilian political sector. In his year-end national address, for example, he categorically rejected the political groups’ recommendations that military troops be withdrawn from the mines, that labor union leaders be permitted to run for national office and that the controversial military-peasant pact be dissolved. His strong stance on these three issues promptly provoked stiff opposition. On the first—the presence of troops in the mines—he sensed he could hang tough—and did. But on the other two he quickly realized that his position was untenable. Within two weeks he reversed his decision on the labor leader question, and by the end of February the High Command formally suspended the military-peasant pact until after the election.\nAlthough Padilla has continually professed neutrality in the electoral process, it has become increasingly clear that he and key members of his government favor the presidential candidacy of Victor Paz Estenssoro. In mid-March, while Padilla was out of the country, military preferences (some for Bernal, some for Paz) translated into subtle pressures on the National Electoral Court. Jealous of their prerogatives, on March 20 the entire court decided to resign en masse—an action that prompted speculation that the election date would be postponed. Confronted by these rumblings, Padilla firmly set the democratization process back on course by rejecting the resignations and putting the court back to work. Later, when 57 separate groups applied for credentials to compete in the elections, Padilla expressed concern that last year’s “political carnival” would be repeated. This concern spawned a tough decree providing for the imposition of severe financial liabilities on any electoral slate that fails to obtain at least 50,000 popular votes. As a result, the number of electoral slates this year will probably not exceed five—thus significantly improving the chances for a stable democratic government.\nIn his single-minded zeal to keep the electoral process on course, Padilla unfortunately has proved short-sighted in other related areas. One of these is the economy. In a poor state when he took power, it has steadily deteriorated since. Padilla has resisted implementing significant corrective measures because he does not want to open the way for further criticism of the armed forces and because he fears that popular discontent could interfere with the democratization schedule. He has been notably less concerned about the prodigious burden that, as a result of his inaction, will be left for his successor.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1979LAPAZ03402\nDate: April 19, 1979\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 jan 1960\nConcepts: POLITICAL STABILITY, TRENDS, POLITICAL SITUATION"

This committee was formed at the inaugural plenary session to review the following: (A) Consideration and adoption of the recommendations formulated by the Regional Meeting on the Action Plan of the United Nations Water Conference held in Santiago, Chile in October 1978; (B) ECLA objectives, strategies, organization and work plan with regard to water; and (C) Consideration and adoption of the report of the Sessional Committee on Water. Trinidad was elected Chairman of Committee III with Chile and Canada being elected Vice Chairmen and Mexico elected Rapporteur.\nAfter elections of officers and adoption of the agenda, the Sessional Committee reviewed the report, resolutions and recommendations of the Latin American Regional Meeting on the Action Plan of the UN Water Conference held in Santiago. (Report is outlined on pages 30-39 of ECLA Document 1066 dated April 12, 1979.) The meeting approved all resolutions and recommendations by consensus. US delegation congratulated ECLA on the quality and comprehensiveness of this report. Only major discussion involved Recommendation (B) under Resolution V which identifies ECLA requirement of $300,000 to finance technical cooperation among developing countries in the water field. US delegation indicated that while we support objectives of the resolution, in accordance with US policy we could not support a net increase in the ECLA regular budget for this item. Additional funding would have to come from reallocations from within existing ECLA budget or voluntary contributions. The ECLA Secretariat noted that approval of Resolution V did not commit any delegation to approval of specific budget allocations, and that this would be considered in the Fifth Committee.\nThe committee then proceeded to consider the ECLA work program with regard to water contained in the following documents: (A) Implementation of the Mar del Plata Action Plan at the regional level (Note by the Secretariat - ECLA Document 1077), and (B) the water resource projects described in pages 85-87 of ECLA’s 1979-81 Work Program (ECLA Document 1068) were reviewed in detail and approved by the committee.\nMajor discussion of sessional meeting focused on CEPAL Document 1077 (ECLA objectives, strategies, organization and work plan with regard to water) which was approved with the modifications noted below. US delegation expressed general satisfaction with the document but requested following changes: (A) Document 1077 called for regular meetings of government experts or groups of experts outside the regular Sessional Committee meetings. It was indicated that such meetings might be held every six to twelve months. Argentina strongly supported the idea of regular meetings every six months to give guidance to ECLA Secretariat on water related matters. US and Brazilian delegations vigorously questioned the need for these regular meetings and expressed concern about the growing proliferation of international meetings. Text of US statement to the committee on this issue follows. “We agreed last October to create this Sessional Committee as the intergovernmental body for giving direction to the ECLA Secretariat in area of water resources and sanitation. The US delegation is generally concerned about proliferation of international bodies and meetings. If there is genuine widespread interest in having other experts meeting to consider horizontal cooperation in the field of water, such meetings could be scheduled in the future. For the time being, however, it is our delegation’s impression that the structure of this Sessional Committee is adequate. Interested governments can send experts to this Sessional Committee. If evidence shows that the interest of member governments in the water area is such that the Sessional Committee is overwhelmed by its workload, we could then entertain the idea of more frequent ad hoc meetings of government water experts.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1979LAPAZ03534\nDate: April 23, 1979\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 jan 1960\nConcepts: WATER, COMMITTEES"

This is done to encourage such personnel to remain in key positions of leadership within the government in the face of employment offers from other agencies, multinational or private sector, which offer remuneration substantially above GOB civil service scale. In this sense we top off the salary for a fixed time period until, hopefully, GOB civil service scale for the position is adjusted upward and encourage the key leader not to leave the country or the GOB.\nWinston Estremadoiro is a Bolivian leader who fits these criteria. He completed a Bachelor’s degree at the University of Houston, a Master’s degree at the University of California, Los Angeles, and is a candidate for the Ph.D. at UCLA (lacking only his dissertation for graduation). His fields of expertise are rural sociology and social anthropology. In addition to having worked with indigenous leaders in most geographic areas of Bolivia, he organized, then administered, PRODES (Project for the Development of the Chapare and Yungas) for two years with a high degree of success.\nMr. Estremadoiro is a natural leader, is highly motivated, and knows how to move programs and projects through the Bolivian government and society. In our opinion he will be a key element in any development effort we help finance in the coca zones. He has had several attractive offers to leave the GOB (from the Andean Pact and the Organization of American States among others). We propose to supplement his salary as Executive Director of PRODES, now fixed by the GOB at US \\(736 per month (\\)B 15,000), if he agrees to return to that important position. While no negotiations have been completed with Mr. Estremadoiro pending approval of relevant USG agencies, we would propose to supplement his GOB salary by up to US $1,025 per month. This would bring his total salary up to a level equal to his current earnings under contract and would approximate the offers he has received from other non-GOB entities.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1979LAPAZ07538\nDate: September 05, 1979\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 jan 1960\nConcepts: AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT, GRANTS"

The resolution resulted in the appointment of a special technical committee of the Lower House, consisting of lawyers, engineers and other experts to study the issue and make recommendations. Bolivian Power responded with its own initiative, i.e., a lease-sale arrangement with fees to be paid over twenty years after which the Bolivian Government would receive title to the company’s assets for no additional costs and with no interest payments. In a conversation with the Ambassador on October 16, Energy Minister O’Connor stated that Bolivian Power’s proposal was an acceptable basis for negotiation, but that a number of specific elements of the proposal were unacceptable to the GOB.\nThe company.\n\n\nCompania Boliviana de Energia Electrica, S.A.–Bolivian Power Company Limited, produces and supplies hydro-electric energy to the cities of La Paz and Oruro, Bolivia, the adjoining areas, and nearby tin mines. Bolivian offices are located in La Paz and the company’s head office is in St. John’s, Antigua, West Indies. In 1978, the company sold 415.3 million kilowatt hours generating gross revenue of $US 11.3 million with net income of $US 3.4 million.\nBolivian Power is incorporated in Nova Scotia, Canada, and until October 1977 was owned by Canadian International Power Company, Ltd. On June 30, 1978 Bolivian Power formed a partnership, Hemisphere Leasing Associates, with Baldwin United Corporation of Cincinnati, Ohio, which holds 49.8 percent of Bolivian Power’s common stock. In September 1978 Dayton Hydraulics Company became a general partner and October 1978 the partnership was reorganized as an Antiguan partnership.\nIn January 1979 the shareholders approved the contribution of Bolivian Power’s beneficial interest in substantially all of its electric utility property, plant and equipment which had a recorded book value of about $US 40 million to its partnership, Hemisphere Leasing, in exchange for 50 percent partnership interest. Bolivian Power retains legal title to the assets. The other partners contributed $US 10 million to be used for purchasing property or equipment to be leased to or financed for third parties primarily in the US. Bolivian Power then entered into a ten-year lease with Hemisphere Associates for rental of all assets; the lease can be renewed through September 30, 1999 when Bolivian Power’s franchise to operate in Bolivia expires.\n\n\nBackground.\n\n\nAccording to a July 24, 1964 agreement with the GOB, Bolivian Power is entitled to earn an annual return of nine percent on its asset base and in any period that it does not earn nine percent, it is entitled to recoup the deficiencies. In 1977 and 1978 Bolivian Power’s rate of return was 7.7 and 6.5 percent respectively. As of December 21, 1978 the accumulated deficit totaled $US 18.3 million. To increase the rate of return, to cover past deficits, and to cover increasing costs, Bolivian Power asked for rate increases of 27.32 percent on December 13, 1977, 72.51 percent on December 12, 1978, and most recently a modified request of 64.03 percent in January 1979. These rate increases were not granted. The latest one is being studied by the GOB and has generated a great deal of publicity.\nSparked by the publicity from the rate increase request, a resolution seeking confiscation or nationalization of Bolivian Power was submitted in the new Congress. The resolution was modified creating a special Technical Commission of the Chamber of Deputies to prepare recommendations and report back to the Congress. The commission is composed of the following members: Jorge O’Connor, Ministry of Energy; Engineer Oscar Morales; Dr. Hugo Urquieta (lawyer); and Jose Raul Garzon.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1979LAPAZ08835\nDate: October 17, 1979\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 jan 1960\nConcepts: NATIONALIZATION, COMPENSATION, CENTRAL LEGISLATURE, RESOLUTIONS, PUBLIC UTILITIES"

Annex B of Survey Report of Narcotics Law Enforcement Study Team No. 4 (April-May 1972) gives a good picture of problems faced by GOB in coming to grips with the narcotics problem in Bolivia and proposes a strategy and plan of action for USG assistance which this Embassy through its Narcotics Control Action Plans has been trying to implement since that time.\nWhile considerable progress has been made, e.g., the passage of a comprehensive narcotics law, the assignment of a DEA unit to the US Embassy, fairly extensive training to Bolivian enforcement officers both in the US and in-country, and the provision of equipment and operating funds to the narcotics unit in the police force, we are still in Phase I of the two-phase approach recommended in the Survey Report.\nIn the advisory category, the narcotics advisor would help the GOB in the difficult initial task of developing rationally the various segments of a comprehensive program of narcotics control, to be implemented by new units authorized under Bolivia’s recently enacted Narcotics Control Law, (especially the high level entity with many added functions beyond enforcement). Certain of these activities probably will be formalized into various project agreements involving reasonable US financial and appropriate technical assistance.\nIn the institution building phase, the narcotics advisor would assist the GOB in working out a system of coordination and control of the various groups in Bolivia that have an interest or role in narcotics control efforts, e.g., various units in the police force, National Customs, Agricultural Customs, provincial authorities and the four Ministries members of the National Narcotics Control Board. The new overall narcotics entity authorized in the recent law should come into official being in the next few months, but needs our technical help. During its formative stage, when the institutional battles are being fought which will determine to a considerable degree what practical authority and influence this entity will have, it would be in our interest to provide support in the form of close, full-time liaison as well as some financial and appropriate technical assistance.\nWith regard to paragraph 2, reftel, we do indeed wish to retain the services of David S. Arroyo, USAID Public Safety Officer, for the new position. We do not suggest that Public Safety experience per se would be utilized in basic research to develop statistics on coca production, distribution and consumption. Basically the need is to bird-dog the Bolivians to do this job and it would be but one of several insignificant tasks of the narcotics advisor. We wish to keep Arroyo because he already has a deep knowledge of Bolivia and Bolivians, a demonstrated capacity to be effective, and the personal qualities of persuasiveness, tact, and charm that will assure this Mission of maximum effectiveness in the pursuit of our interests in the narcotics field during this complicated, ground-breaking period. Arroyo is bilingual. Arroyo already is preparing the groundwork for the relationships envisioned above, and the Ambassador has received personal requests from both the new Minister of Interior and the Sub-Secretary of Justice (at present the highest authorities in narcotics matters) that Arroyo be assigned to the new narcotics entity as a full-time advisor.\nRegarding comment in paragraph 3 reftel, we believe that DEA representatives here will continue to be effective in their enforcement role if they are the primary contacts with the Bolivian Narcotics Enforcement Unit, which we conceive of being an arm of the overall narcotics unit. Due to his previous experience with the Bolivian Narcotics Enforcement Unit and his pioneering work in getting that unit established and operating, Arroyo will be of great service in providing counsel to DEA. However, we do not wish to encourage any confusion in the minds of the leaders of that police enforcement unit as to whom they must do business with in the US Mission, and we have therefore given DEA that responsibility. Furthermore, we believe that substituting DEA for OPS in the performance of duties in narcotics support work formerly done by OPS should remove any doubts that may remain in Washington that the establishment of a narcotics advisor position is merely a way of retaining the old OPS relationship here. Of major importance, however, is our belief that once confirmed in his new role as described above, Arroyo would be able to devote only a very small percentage of his time to the needs of the enforcement unit, whereas DEA can do this on a day-to-day basis. Finally, the Ambassador feels strongly that the retention of Mr. Arroyo here and his assignment to this position would make a meaningful contribution to the US Government’s efforts on the narcotics front in Bolivia.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1974LAPAZ01807\nDate: March 25, 1974\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 JAN 1960\nConcepts: DRUG CONTROL, FOREIGN ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS, PERSONNEL ASSIGNMENTS"

These rather extraordinary events were acclaimed by a rather extraordinary reaction in La Paz on Friday evening as a cheering crowd jammed the Plaza Murillo in front of the Congressional and government palaces while elsewhere citizens’ shouting and honking of automobile horns–as if Bolivia had won the American Cup Soccer Competition– signaled their jubilation over this remarkable return to constitutionalism after two weeks of grim, suppressive military government. Indeed, the change was akin to the sudden abrupt termination of a protracted nightmare.\nAccording to press reports, the Cabinet–expected to be announced Monday Nov 19–will be one of “National Unity,” which can be interpreted to signify participation by some of the major political groups, particularly Victor Paz’ MNR Alliance. We are already reliably informed that Augusto Cuadros Sanchez, Minister of Economy in one of the Paz administrations, will be the new Finance Minister. Cuadros Sanchez is described as a conservative economist and one who can be expected to take a firm hand in confronting Bolivia’s critical economic situation.\nOn the international front, President Gueiler reiterated Bolivia’s close adherence to the Andean Pact and called for all democracies to support the new Bolivian return to constitutionalism, particularly in confronting Bolivia’s economic problems. Front page press treatment was given the Department’s description of events here as a “dramatic victory for the Bolivian people,” with the expectation of a normalization of diplomatic relations. We might add that we have already received several calls from various sectors, including Bolivian deputies and public servants, expressing appreciation and gratitude for U.S. policy not to do business with Natusch.\nIn the meantime, the Parliament’s unanimous choice of Lidia Gueiler is reflected in a similar closing of ranks among other sectors. Former President Walter Guevara Arze announced the end of his “clandestine government,” noting that it had effectively accomplished its purpose in contributing in no small measure to Bolivia’s return to democracy. Labor leaders described the events as a triumph for the workers, and Bolivia’s National Labor Federation (COB) in a message to workers hailed their contribution and called for continued unity and vigilance. These reactions are typical elsewhere in Bolivia as press reports indicate jubilation and a relaxation of the tense atmosphere in Bolivia’s major urban centers.\nWith the exception of an announcement that Bolivia’s banks are closed until further notice–a continuation of the banking holiday declared last week after the Central Bank closed its foreign exchange window–La Paz is expected to return to normal very quickly. The new government has officially lifted the state of siege, which in a sense had already become an unobserved anachronism by the weekend.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1979LAPAZ09950\nDate: November 19, 1979\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 jan 1960\nConcepts: DEMOCRACY, POPULAR SUPPORT, CENTRAL LEGISLATURE, ELECTIONS, FORM OF GOVERNMENT"

THERE IS A GROWING FEELING WHICH HAS BEEN EXPRESSED TO MANY OFFICERS AT THE MISSION THAT THE DIFFICULTIES THAT BOLIVIA IS ENCOUNTERING IN ACQUIRING NEW AGREEMENTS FOR PL-480 IS THE RESULT OF A FUNDAMENTAL SHIFT IN US POLICY FROM HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE TO COMMERCIAL SALES. THERE IS ALSO EQUAL MISUNDER- STANDING THAT THIS SHIFT IN POLICY MAY BE APPLIED ONLY TO BOLIVIA. MEMBERS OF THIS MISSION HAVE DONE A GOOD JOB IN ATTEMPTING TO EXPLAIN THAT THE PL-480 PROGRAM IS BASED ON THE EXISTENCE OF EXCESS COMMODITIES AND THAT IN SPITE OF LARGE US PRODUCTION, THE COMMERCIAL SALES PRECLUDE PL-480 PROGRAMS ON THE SCALE OF PREVIOUS YEARS. WE HAVE ALSO ATTEMPTED TO EXPLAIN THAT THIS AFFECTS BOLIVIA BUT IS NOT POINTED AT BOLIVIA. I DO NOT THINK THAT WE ARE GETTING OUR MESSAGE ACROSS AND KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WITH WHOM WE DO NOT HAVE DIRECT CONTACT WHO MIS- UNDERSTAND RECENT COMMODITY DEVELOPMENTS. I AM NOT INTER- ESTED IN A STORY TAILORMADE FOR BOLIVIA; RATHER IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE MUST BE IN COUNTRIES OTHER THAN THIS ONE, SERIOUS QUESTIONS\n\n061614Z\nAND DOUBTS BEING RAISED WHICH COULD WELL BE PUT TO REST BY A\nSKILLFUL PRESENTATION OF THE FACTS SURROUNDING CHANGES IN OUR ABILITY TO CARRY ON PL-480 OF THE MAGNITUDE OF PREVIOUS YEARS.\n\nTHE PUBLIC AFFAIRS OFFICER OF THIS POST HAS REQUESTED USIA TO DEVELOP A STORY ALONG THESE LINES WHICH REPORTS THAT IT HAS ENCOUNTERED NEGATIVE REACTIONS FROM AID, STATE AND AGRICULTURE. THE ASSERTION IS THAT TRYING TO EXPLAIN THE SITUATION MIGHT DO MORE HARM THAN GOOD. THIS IS A POSITION WHICH NO ONE HERE AT THIS MISSION IS ABLE TO UNDERSTAND. IT HAS ALSO BEEN ASSERTED THAT A STORY ABOUT THE PL-480 SITUATION COULD DO SOMETHING WITH THE MARKET WHICH IS EQUALLY DIFFICULT FOR US HERE TO FATHOM\nTHE PURPOSE OF THIS MESSAGE IS TO ATTEMPT TO ELICIT A FAVOR- ABLE RESPONSE FROM WASHINGTON AGENCIES TO OVERCOME BY A WELL DEVELOPED STORY THE HALF TRUTHS AND MISINFORMATION ALREADY APPEARING IN US AND FOREIGN NEWSPAPERS. WE HERE RECOGNIZE THAT BOLIVIA HAS HAD GOOD FORTUNE WITHIN THE PL-480 ALLOCATIONS BUT THIS HEIGHTENS RATHER THAN LESSENS THE NEED FOR A WELL REASONED STORY FOR WORLDWIDE CONSUMPTION. I CAN VISUALIZE THE INCLUSION IN SUCH A STORY OF SOME OF THE SIGNIFICANT ACCOMPLISH- MENTS OF PL-480 PROGRAMS BASED ON THE USE OF LOCAL CURRENCY. INCLUDED IN SUCH SUCH INFORMATION MIGHT BE A PRESENTATION OF PROGRAMS WHICH HAVE HAD SUCCESS IN RAISING DOMESTIC PRODUCTION OF FOODSTUFFS.\nIF IT IS NOT POSSIBLE FOR USIA TO PUT OUT SUCH A STORY, COULD WE NOT COMMISSION ON A CONTRACT A SKILLED JOURNALIST TO PRODUCE SUCH A STORY POSSIBLY FOR PUBLICATION IN AN ACCEPTABLE US PUBLICATION. THIS THEN COULD BE REPRODUCED IN THE LOCAL MEDIA FOR SUBSTANTIAL BENEFIT IN ACHIEVING UNDERSTANDING OF OUR SITUATION.

Guevara told them that in his view Paz’ and Siles’ choice was elections in ‘81 or a return to military government, since a call for May 1980 elections would maintain the current political climate at a confrontational pitch which would provoke a military coup before elections. Guevara claimed that with Paz’ and Siles’ support for a two-year term, special economic powers and reduction of the charges against Banzer, Guevara could assuage the military, stabilize the economy and hand over a working civilian democracy to someone else in 1981. Without this support, he feared the worse. Neither Paz nor Siles has given Guevara a response. The fat is now in the fire and Guevara’s government, and maybe civilian rule, are headed for a showdown by early November on a complex set of questions – the two-year Guevara term, economic stabilization and changes in the military high command. End Summary.\nIn an October 4 meeting with me, President Guevara said he was deeply worried by the deterioration of the political climate that he found on his return from Panama. The military – with good reason – felt threatened by the looming indictment of General Banzer and associates. The Congress was handling this badly and everything else not at all. The military, Congress and labor were exchanging charges and threats at a pitch which Bolivia’s fragile democracy could not long survive. General Padilla was losing his authority within the military and hotter heads now sensed an opportunity to hatch their own political plans, including some to close down the Congress. In the course of our 90-minute meeting, Guevara elaborated on each of these points of concern.\nBoth the military and the Congress, Guevara said, were at fault in the current confrontation over the likely indictment of Hugo Banzer. The military had a shabby record of corrupt administration and should have anticipated that no representative government could protect them from an airing of this record. Also, the military had to recognize that the General Staff’s views on what was desirable for Bolivia were now not the last word but one of several voices in a complex process of accommodation. The Congress, on the other hand, was a “mediocre lot” which had let Marcelo Quiroga Santa Cruz and his tiny party dominate the agenda and the tone of the Congress and to use this position to goad the military in a way which would weaken the moderate elements as well as imperil civilian government. The two major coalitions, the MNR Alliance and the UDP, should never have allowed consideration of an indictment of the undefined group of “Banzer and his associates” since a large group of officers could see themselves as potential associates in seven years of military government. Guevara said Paz and Siles in their meeting with him on October 3 had agreed to seek an indictment resolution (to emerge from committee at the end of October) which would charge only Banzer and a few named associates with specific offenses, particularly corruption, but the damage of arousing the whole officer corps had already been done.\nGuevara was distressed that the exchange of threats between the Congress and the military over the Banzer indictment had now been augmented by an exchange of accusing communiques between the military and the Labor Union Federation (COB) over the military budget. Before Guevara left for Panama, Padilla had promised that no more communiques would be issued by the military without coordination with Guevara.\nTo Guevara, the fact that Padilla felt compelled to issue the attack on the COB was one of several indications that Padilla was losing his grip on the military. In his recent consultations with unit commanders, Padilla was apparently playing with the idea of military intervention to keep himself at the front of the pack. Guevara feared that if Padilla could not control the military some hothead would try a coup against the Congress, Guevara or both. The COB would respond with a general strike and civilians and the military would be in a confrontation without a peaceful solution.\nGuevara believed that several groups within the military were cooking political plots and if anyone could bring them together on one strategy, there could be a coup. He felt that Army Chief of Staff Julio Herrera was the one hothead who had the will and position to bring the malcontents together. Therefore, he had to move to replace Herrera. Guevara said he had to change his cabinet soon in any event, to replace at least ineffective ministers of mines and health. He wanted to use this occasion to kick Herrera upstairs to the Minister of Defense position and to replace him with General Jorge Terrazas, commander of the Seventh Division in Cochabamba. (Terrazas would then move up to Army Commander position when General Azero retires in December.) Guevara said he also planned to replace the commander of the Military Police Battalion, Captain Luis Montero, who insists on being Guevara’s watchdog. Guevara said he would present these changes to Padilla this weekend.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1979LAPAZ08491\nDate: October 05, 1979\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 20 Mar 2014\nConcepts: PRESIDENT, POLICIES, POLITICAL STABILITY, POLITICAL MILITARY RELATIONS, PRESIDENTIAL SUCCESSION, ELECTIONS"

MOST SPEECHES DURING THE RALLIES ATTACKED THE UNITED STATES AND DENOUNCED THE PROS- PECTIVE SALE OF TIN FROM ITS STRATEGIC RESERVES. CHILE, ITS GOVERNMENT, AND ITS OAS REPRESENTATIVE ALSO WERE ATTACKED FOR DENYING BOLIVIA ACCESS TO THE SEA. SEVERAL POLITICIANS JOINED MARCHERS IN LA PAZ, BUT NOTABLEY ABSENT WAS LABOR LEADER JUAN LECHIN. END SUMMARY.\nTO MOST OBSERVERS THE OCTOBE R 25 “ANTI-IMPERIALIST” MARCH IN LA PAZ APPEARED TO BE THE BEST ORGANIZED AND BEST ATTENDED\n\n290743Z\nDEMONSTRATION SPONSORED BY THE CONFEDERATION OF BOLIVIAN WORKERS (COB) IN RECENT YEARS. ESTIMATES OF CROWD SIZE VARY. TWO OF LA PAZ’ NEWSPAPERS, HOY AND PRESENCIA, ESTIMATED THE CROWD TO “NUMBER IN THE THOUSANDS.” EL DIARIO, ANOTHER LA PAZ MORNING PAPER, REPORTED 15,000 PEOPLE PARTICIPATED IN THE DEMONSTRATIN. BY WAY OF CONTRAST, POLICE COLONEL SALINAS, WHO COMMANDED THE RIOT POLICE DETACHMENT OUTSIDE THE SHERATON DURING THE 80 MINUTE\n       Sheryl P. Walter \n\n      Sheryl P. Walter \nPARADE, CALCULATED THE MARCHERS NUMBERED SIX OR SEVEN THOUSAND PEOPLE.\n\nMOST SPEECHES BEFORE AND AFTER THE MARCH DENOUNCED THE US AND THE PROSPECTIVE SALE OF TIN FROM STRATEGIC STOCKPILES. FELIX LACUMSA, STUDENT LEADER AT SAN ANDRES UNIVERSITY, ACCUSED THE US OF “DEALING A HARD BLOW TO BOLIVIA’S ONGOING DEMOCRATIZATION PROCESS” WHILE GENARO FLORES, A CAMPESINO LEADER, CHARGED THE US WITH BEING “THE FIRST TO VIOLATE HUMAN RIGHTS.”\nCHOICE WORDS WERE ALSO RESERVED FOR THE CHILEAN GOVERNMENT AND ITS OAS REPRESENTATIVE FOR DENYING BOLIVIA ACCESS TO THE SEA. OSCAR SALAS, A LEADER OF THE MINERS, ANNOUNCED “THE PEOPLE WILL CONTINUE FIGHTING UNTIL BOLIVIA RETURNS TO THE SEA.” CHANTS DURING THE MARCH ALSO CALLED FOR “DEATH TO DAZA (CHILEAN OAS REP) AND PINOCHET” AND “DOWN WITH CHILEANS.” SOME PLACARDS CARRIED BY FACTORY WORKERS CALLED FOR THE DISMISSAL OF CHILEANS WORKING IN BOLIVIAN FACTORIES.\nABSENT FROM THE LA PAZ MARCH WAS JUAN LECHIN, EXECUTIVE SECRETARY OF THE COB. BUT, AMONG MARCHERS LABATT IDENTIFIED MARCELO QUIROGA SANTA CRUZ, PS-1 LEADER AND ITS DEPUTY FOR COCHABAMBA; OSCAR EID, MIR LEADER; AND JAIME PAZ ZAMORA, MIR LEADER AND UDP VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE IN 1979. THEY WERE WELL RECEIVED BY THE CROWD OUTSIDE THE SHERATON HOTEL.\n\n290743Z\n\nLA PAZ NEWSPAPERS OF OCTOBER 26 ALSO COMMENTED BRIEFLY ON SIMILAR DEMONSTRATIONS IN ORURO AND COCHABAMBA. SPEECHES APPERAED TO BE SIMILAR IN CONTENT. PRESENCIA ESTIMATED THE COCHABAMBA MARCH DREW TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE. HOY CLAIMED “THOUSANDS” OF PEOPLE PARTICIPATED IN THE ORURO RALLY.\nCOMMENT: THE LARGE TURN OUT AT THE COB DEMONSTRATIONS THROUGHOUT BOLIVIA CAN BE EXPLAINED BY THE FACT THAT: (1) TIN AND ACCESS TO THE SEA ARE THE TWO ISSUES IN BOLIVIA ON WHICH THERE IS WIDESPREAD CONSENSUS; (2) STUDENTS JOINED THE COB MARCH; AND (3) THE DEMONSTRATIONS WERE SCHEDULED FOR MID-AFTERNOON INSTEAD OF AFTER WORKING HOURS. DESPITE THE DEPTH OF BOLIVIAN FEELINGS ON THESE ISSUES, THE DEMONSTRATIONS WERE IMPRESSIVE FOR THEIR DISCIPLINE AND PEACE- FULNESS. BOEKER\n   Sheryl P. Walter \nSheryl P.

The order stated that this measure was being taken to permit fundamental adjustments in the country’s financial system and to avoid unnecessary confusion in normal banking operations.\nThis came after the Central Bank’s Nov 13 decision to close its foreign exchange window. Banks were open Nov 14 but only for peso transactions; the banks were busy but there was no “run” on pesos. On Thursday, Nov 15, banks and money exchange houses were closed throughout Bolivia catching many people without sufficient pesos to seem them through the four day period until the banks reopen on Monday. The market exchange rate reached as high as 38 pesos to the dollar in La Paz.\nAdding to the unrest and devaluation expectations created by the bank holidays, on Nov 15 newspapers and the radio carried news items indicating that the GOB was conducting conversations with the IMF and would announce an economic package shortly. Leaving Thursday’s early morning cabinet meeting, Minister of Finance Agapito Monzon told reporters that an economic package worked out with the IMF had been discussed at the meeting. He assured reporters that the package would not include devaluation and would not raise prices of gasoline, kerosene, and diesel. Resigned to economic measures, the general public remains unconvinced although hopeful that no devaluation will take place. Rumors abound and in Santa Cruz, where surplus contraband dollars frequently move the official exchange rate downward; dollars were not even available from the many street traders.\nSanta Cruz has been particularly affected by Bolivia’s economic situation. Importers, an important component of its economy, have been unable to obtain the foreign exchange necessary to meet their foreign credit obligations. Other local businesses have been affected by the GOB’s failure to reimburse the sugar mills for the 1979 harvest causing the impact to be felt and multiplied throughout the local economy.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1979LAPAZ09866\nDate: November 15, 1979\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 jan 1960\nConcepts: DECISION, BANKS, HOLIDAYS"

Such a compromise would seem to be consonant with the constitution, which provides for the head of the Senate to preside over the government in the absence of the elected President and Vice President.\nThe Guevara arrangement is being brokered exclusively between the MNR Alliance and the UDP. Representatives of both these groups have pointed out that such a possibility has been under consideration for some time and that the ADN thus has no claim to paternity. As a condition prior, Victor Paz and Hernan Siles reportedly have already renounced their claims on the Presidency.\nIn the late evening of August 5, an agreement in principle was reached, and Guevara gave a press conference to describe the government he intends to head. He said his purpose would be national conciliation and that both the MNR and the UDP would play important roles. He added that he expected to have the full support of the armed forces, which would retain the defense portfolio. During his “transitional” tenure, Guevara said, he would address the economic situation, which he described as serious but manageable and, with the Congress, attempt to rewrite the electoral law so as to avoid a repetition of the 1979 impasse. In recorded remarks, PDC leader Benjamin Miguel said renewed elections would be called for May 1980, but Guevara himself is reported to have remarked that they might have to slide until 1981.\nThe compromise was expected to have been formalized by the Congress in the early morning of August 6. However, at the last moment some snags developed and the MNR asked for more time. After some unhelpful interventions by PS-1 Deputy Marcelo Quiroga, the Congress suspended session until 10 AM on August 6.\nAlthough the inauguration will not take place in the morning as scheduled, optimism persists that the Guevara compromise will be firmed up soon—perhaps before August 7.

Present FSL economic/commercial staff of four serves four officers including COMATT. Of these four only one qualified as typist and workload for other econ officers is such that she cannot RPT not handle COMATT typing.\nMajor areas of activity for first three months of 1973 and 1974 reflect following increase:\n       1973   1974\nA. Outgoing WTDRs 21 79 B. US Visitors 31 75 C. Local Visitors 214 254 D. ADS 3 13 E. Private Trade Opportunities 14 62 F. GOB Tenders 3 13\nTrade promotion requires active participation of members of commercial section. Prior to arrival of new COMATT, local members seldom left office to promote US commercial services. From March 1-27 visits to private and public firms totaled 72. It is impossible to keep staff busy on outside with promotional work when there is insufficient clerical help to take care of resulting paperwork. Cannot RPT not stress too strongly need for this additional FSL position. Feel great US commercial gains can be made in Bolivia and full intent of CAP realized with adequate help. Would appreciate telegraphic authorization this essential FSL position.\nPost has reviewed its program positions in an attempt to free some other position for commercial assistance. However, reduction of two program positions this post by Department in January has already reduced staffing to absolute bare minimum.

I noted that I have presented new recommendations to Washington for expediting certain equipment for the Bolivian Tipos. As to economic assistance, I noted the continuous and comprehensive efforts of our AID mission to work in the agricultural, public health and education fields, giving me every confidence of a sustained and effective economic cooperation program with his government. I told him I could not understand where his representatives in Washington could have obtained views that our government felt he would soon fall. I indicated our policy was unchanged and it was one of continued support for the GOB and its effort to bring progress and development to the country. I asked for guidance as to which Bolivian authorities the US Mission should work with in attempting to devise a more concrete project for agricultural assistance along the lines he had suggested. I attempted to probe as to whether he thought he had a financial problem or a supply problem. His response was most general and indicated that he had needs both financial and equipment. As I departed Presidential Palace, I met Brazilian Ambassador entering, who, I had been informed informally, was being summoned also for requests for assistance.\nComment: While there may be elements of fact in the synthesis of international concentration of extremists on Bolivia, I have been told that the Zenteno story has not been confirmed and that much of the difficulty in the Cochabamba area is home grown. I agree with his lament about our inability to have kept up the rhythm of deliveries of military equipment for the Tipos. I believe also that the style and pace of our AID economic assistance programs is appropriate and well focused. However, given our continued policy to attempt to support this President and his administration, I do intend to search with the help of our AID and economic people for some ways to assist in the agricultural area, possibly through the device of re-programming counterpart, local currency accumulations and the use of ongoing project activities.\nI would appreciate prompt reaction from State and Defense as to ways and means in which we might meet the request for expedited action on MAP equipment submitted in La Paz telegram 608. It would go a long way, I believe, to helping the psychological mood here and to meeting our foreign policy objectives. If State/AID have any suggestions with regard to the requests for emergency economic assistance, I would of course be delighted to have them as promptly as possible. It would also be of interest to me if there is any way of ascertaining the basis for the report that Bolivian representatives in Washington are informing President Banzer that USG has reached the conclusion that he is soon to fall.\n\nStedman\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1974LAPAZ00676\nDate: January 31, 1974\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 JAN 1960\nConcepts: n/a"

Paper uses semi-official estimate of eight percent increase for imports in ’79, whereas ’78 increase was 23 percent (FOB) and preliminary data indicate January ’79 imports soared more than 50 percent above same month last year. On ’79 exports paper uses 10 percent increase for B/P estimates and 8-12 percent for calculating debt service rations, whereas we now expect no increase in ’79 exports (as result continuing fall in tin production, delays in gas pipeline expansion, to Argentina, and impact of flooding on agricultural exports). These trends indicate a very large current account deficit this year in range of $500-$550 million and an over-all deficit of maybe $250-$300 million. Reserve loss in first two months of ’79 was $20 million, but would have been much higher but for special factors. Liquid reserves are nearing rock bottom and government will probably increase its arrears on official debt significantly in March. Separate cable covers recent economic picture in more detail.\nThe financial situation is, therefore, likely to reach critical stage by July to September timeframe, not 1980, as cited in ECP paper. There are some factors associated with the July/August election and change of government which will themselves accelerate deterioration. Some banks are now holding up on new loans to GOB, pending clarification of political prospects. Proverbial uncertainty with political change in Bolivia should also lead to more capital flight. Very large peso deposits with (shaky) maintenance of value guarantee are a potential source of large capital flight whenever psychological worm turns. The military’s rushing to take care of itself in dying days of military government will aggravate B/P situation (DOLS 100 million in arms purchases being most blatant example).\nEqually important political factors argue clearly for a stabilization program shortly after August inauguration. The elected government, as Vic Paz indicated to me, will want to try to survive the popular backlash to economic stabilization measures by 1) fixing the blame squarely on previous governments and 2) making use of its fresh electoral mandate. That government will want to weather this storm at a time when the military is not yet ready to challenge it and hope to be on the up side of “J” curve before the military begins to look critically at the civilian government’s record.\nA US program loan can play an important part in this–not because of the amount, which is helpful but not critical, but because of the timing and politics. A US program loan early in the period of the elected government, close in time to a stabilization program, lends significant international blessing and, therefore, domestic weight to that government and its program. What the US thinks and does still carries great clout in Bolivia, and a program will be easier to adopt, at the right time, with overt US support. There are undoubtedly a dozen Latin American countries where this is not true, but Bolivia is different.\nIn considering US program lending, we should consider both FY79 and FY80 funds. As far as I am concerned, only one project in these two years is untouchable–the Chapare agricultural development loan; that we need to do for our own interests.\nAs regards the content of a stabilization program, it is not correct to view the IMF’s October 1978 program as an on-the-shelf program, ready to go in August 1979 or whenever. With the continuing deterioration of the financial situation, the corrective measures needed have changed and may change further. The IMF’s program of “de-dollarization” of guaranteed deposits is totally unfeasible at this point. With the existing state of low confidence a ten percentage point differential in interest rates would not move investors out of dollar-guaranteed deposits. New, more drastic solutions are needed, such as a succession of exchange rate changes, with the guarantee not renewed after the initial change and pay-off. Regardless of monetary consequences, exchange rate reform can no longer be avoided. With a debt service ration headed past 40 percent, I do not see how debt rescheduling can be avoided either. The ceilings on new borrowings, Central Bank credit to the public sector, etc., have to be reworked as well. We should encourage the IMF and IBRD on one hand, and the leading Bolivian electoral candidates on the other, to start developing the elements of a new program for August/September.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1979LAPAZ02233\nDate: March 14, 1979\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 20 Mar 2014\nConcepts: PAPERS, AMBASSADORS"

A FULL BIO- REPORT ON HIM DATED JANUARY 1971 IS CONTAINED IN THE BIO- GRAPHIC HANDBOOK, THE REPORT CARRIES HIS CAREER UP TO HIS APPOINTMENT AS AMBASSADOR TO THE UK AND THE NETHERLANDS, A POST HE HELD UNTIL ABOUT A MONTH AGO. LECHIN IS A MODERATE CONSERVATIVE WITH BROAD ADMINISTRATIVE EXPERIENCE (E.G. PRESIDENT OF THE BOLIVIAN MINING CORPORATION FROM 1964 TO 1968). LECHIN HAS A GOOD REPUTATION AMONG MILITARY AND CIVILIANS ALIKE.\nVICTOR CASTILLO SUAREZ - MINISTER OF FINANCE - COL CAS- TILLO WAS BORN IN 1924. HE WAS UNTIL RECENTLY HEAD OF THE MILITARY SCHOOL IN COCHABAMBA (INCLUDING THE COMMAND AND GENERAL STAFF SCHOOL). THE ARMA HAS BEEN IMPRESSED WITH HIS\n\n110327Z\nSOLID COMPETENCE, BUT HE APPARENTLY HAS NO SPECIAL QUALIFI-\nCATIONS FOR THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE. SOME COLLEAGUES BELIEVE HE MAY BE EASILY INFLUENCED BY HIS STAFF. 4. GENERAL RENE BERNAL ESCALANTE-MINISTER OF DEFENSE A 50- YEAR OLD ARMY OFFICER, HE HAS UNTIL RECENTLY BEEN CHIEF OF THE COMBINED STAFF. HE HAS SERVED AS MILITARY ATTACHE IN WASHINGTON (A HAPPY MEMORABLE EXPERIENCE FOR HIM) AND HAS BEEN VERY CLOSE AND HELPFUL TO MEMBERS OF THE USMILGRP IN BOLIVIA. HE WAS ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL HIGH RANKING OFFICERS INTERESTED IN EXAMINING THE ACQUISITION OF SOVIET MILITARY EQUIPMENT. HOWEVER, HE RECE DENIED REAL INTEREST AND EXPLAINED HIS PARTICIPATION TO THE AMBASSADOR BY SAYING THAT HIS ROLE CONSISTED SOLELY IN REPLYING POLITELY TO OFFERS PRESSED ON HIM BY THE SOVIET EMBASSY. BERNAL WAS MINISTER OF CAMPESINO AFFAIRS FROM 1964 TO 1966 AND IS BELIEVED TO BE HIGHLY IN- TERESTED AND INFORMED ON CAMPESINO MATTERS. 5. LT COL WALDO BERNAL PEREIRA MINISTER OF EDUCATION A FORTY YEAR OLD AIR FORCE OFFICER, BERNAL WAS CHIEF OF THE PRESI- DENTIAL HOUSEHOLD. HE HAS BEEN TO THREE US AIR FORCE SCHOOLS AND SPEAKS GOOD ENGLISH. HE DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF AS COMMANDER OF THE SANTA CRUZ AIR FORCE ACADEMY. HE HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS HIGHLY PROFESSIONAL, PREGMATIC AND VERY CLOSE TO PRESIDENT BANZER BOTH POLITICALLY AND PERSONNALLY. 6. COL ANTONIO ZELAYA S. MINISTER OF MINING ZELAYA IS A 47 YEAR OLD ARMY ENGINEER WHO IS A GEOGRAPHER AND GEODESIST. HE HAS HELD MANY MILITARY AND CIVILIAN SCIENTIFIC AND ACA- DEMIC POSITIONS (INCLUDING RECTOR OF THE UNIVERSITY OF LA PAZ VERY BRIEFLY). HE IS THE MILITARY PRESIDENT OF THE CENTER OF GRADUATES OF THE SCHOOL OF HIGH MILITARY STUDIES. HIS TECHNICAL BACKGROUND SHOULD BE USEFUL, AS THE MINISTRY GIVES GREATER EMPHASIS TO EXPLORATION FOR NEW MINING SITES. 7. CAPTAIN WALTER NUNEZ RIVERO MINISTER OF TRANSPORTATION AND COMMUNICATIONS NUNEZ IS A 44 YEAR OLD NAVAL OFFICER. HE RETURNED FROM LIMA WHERE HE WAS BOLIVIAN NAVAL ATTACHE TO TAKE OVER THE MINISTRY. OLD REPORTS INDICATE THAT HE WAS DYNAMIC AND RESPECTED NAVAL OFFICER, BUT THAT HE APPEARED TO HAVE ENRICHED HIMSELF FROM SEVERAL OF HIS ASSIGNMENTS. HE IS STRONG PROPONENT OF DEVELOPING THE WATERWAYS TRANS- PORTATION IN THE NORTH AND EAST SECTIONS OF THE COUNTRY.\n110327Z\n\nLT COL MARIO VARGAS SALINAS MINISTER OF LABOR VARGAS WAS UNTIL RECENTLY PRESIDENT OF THE BOLIVIAN DEVELOPMENT CORP- PRATION (CBF). HE WAS REPORTEDLY GIVEN THE CBF BECAUSE OF HIS HIGH STANDING AMONG THE YOUNGER OFFICERS AND TO REMOVE HIM FROM THE RANKS OF THOSE PLOTTING AGAINST THE BANZER REGIME. HE HAS LOST STANDING WITH THE YOUNGER OFFICERS BUT SENIOR OFFICERS CONSIDER HIM A STRONG PERFORMER. HE USED HIS POSITION WITH THE CBF TO DEMONSTRATE HIS ORGANIZATIONAL ABILITIES. HE IS POLITICALLY AMBITIOUS AND AS MINISTER OF LABOR WILL BE IN AN IDEAL POSITION TO BUILD A POLITICAL FOLLOWING.\nWE EXPECT TO SEND ADDITINAL FACTS AND COMMENTARY ON THESE INDIVIDUALS OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS. STEDMAN\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1974LAPAZ04457\nDate: July 10, 1974\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 JAN 1960\nConcepts: CABINET, BIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION, PERSONNEL APPOINTMENTS"

As originally planned, project will cost US $58 million, 20 percent of which will be paid by YPFB and the remainder financed by IDB. He stated IDB demands too many requisites and takes too long to disburse. He added that loan negotiations for refineries and lubricant plant have been going on now for over two years and may continue for an additional six months. He added that it is just as convenient financially to borrow commercially (has had offer of 10-year credit from First National Bank of Boston) and roll over credit as it is to borrow from IDB ordinary capital.\nHe said YPFB tired of waiting and has issued cited invitation with deadline of February 18. YPFB expects to get favorable bid from Japanese firms which may agree to receive payment in crude petroleum.\nPrada also said Santa Cruz refinery is to be constructed with 10,000 barrel per day capacity, expandable to 15,000.\nRefair is 1972 “Petroleum Report”, containing more detail on Bolivian petroleum industry. Invitation’s specifications were sent to USDOC (BIC-267) January 3, 1973.\nBolivia’s petroleum exports in 1973 estimated at 11.9 million barrels up from 10.9 million in 1972.\nComment: Should be borne in mind that, if Japanese get contract it will be major entree for them as seller to YPFB as well as buyer of Bolivian crude. Embassy believes that, as indicated to Emboffs earlier on January 8, YPFB would be receptive to a similar offer from U.S. firm.\nAction Requested: Encourage U.S. firms to communicate directly with YPFB ASAP at address shown Reftel. Also, make available to interested U.S. firms the detailed IDB documents on this project.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1974LAPAZ00172\nDate: January 09, 1974\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 JAN 1960\nConcepts: PETROLEUM, CONSTRUCTION, REFINERIES, PROPOSALS (BID), LOANS, NEGOTIATIONS, EXPORT DATA"

Text of Foreign Ministry statement read as follows: “The delegation of Bolivia proposed today in the conference of Foreign Ministers that the following points should be included in the proposals which are presented to the Secretary of State of the United States of America, Henry A. Kissinger: (1) That in the area of Development Assistance, the United States grant most favorable treatment to the least developed countries, and even more to those nations with geographic limitations, such as a land-locked status. (2) That the United States avoid policies and measures which affect the economies of Latin American states which produce minerals and other basic products. Both suggestions received the unanimous support of the Latin American countries meeting in the Mexican capital. The spokesman of the Foreign Ministers presented the first point to Secretary of State Kissinger, who accepted fully this orientation for inclusion in the program of Development Assistance.”\nPresencia editorial, following up on views quoted in reftel, stated that conference had created “a new spirit in hemispheric relations with the United States.” Editorial greets Declaration of Tlatelolco as beginning of “new political order” in which USG will no longer seek to impose unilateral decisions on Latin America. Nonetheless, editorial concludes by warning that such a change cannot be expected to occur suddenly, and calls upon United States to exercise continuing “good will” and “desire to cooperate” with Latin America as proof of its willingness to establish new relationship with the region.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1974LAPAZ01221\nDate: February 28, 1974\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 JAN 1960\nConcepts: PRESS COMMENTS, FOREIGN RELATIONS, FOREIGN MINISTERS MEETINGS, PUBLIC ATTITUDES, FOREIGN POLICY POSITION"

He will be hard pressed to find any good news for his colleagues as he describes the economic results of 1978, and he can scarcely be hopeful in discussing the prospects for 1979. The Central Bank’s latest official (but unpublished) estimate of the 1978 balance of payments deficit is $132 million. Year-end international reserves of the consolidated banking system are now expected by the bank to be approximately $60 million. (Comment: Reserves appear to have been bolstered by short-term borrowings but details are not yet available.) Unless foreign exchange purchases by private citizens are halted, which is unlikely, or new financial credits are obtained, banking system reserves may fall to zero in January or February.\nThis message deals with the performance of the Bolivian economy in 1978, touching as well on structural problems that will continue to affect economic performance in 1979. A subsequent cable will describe the political context in which economic stabilization measures are being considered, and will speculate on the short-term economic policies of the Padilla government. All data in the following paragraphs are drawn from official sources unless otherwise stated. Embassy estimates, which are somewhat more pessimistic, are contained in Table I.\nCurrent account: Central Bank estimates prepared in mid-December project a current account deficit of $370 million. Bolivian export revenues rose by only an estimated 3 percent, to $668.7 million in 1978, despite record world market tin prices. Tin production declined five percent during the year. Petroleum exports, which had been falling since 1974, ended temporarily in October 1978. Sales of gas condensates brought revenues of $79.3 million, $11.9 million more than in 1977. Exports of agricultural products earned $92.3 million, an increase of $9.5 million over 1977. Imports in 1978 increased approximately 20 percent by value to $785 million, despite announced GOB efforts to reduce import growth through public sector budget cuts and changes in monetary policy. The services account deficit is estimated by the GOB to have amounted to $275.6 million, 46 percent greater than the deficit of the previous year. The increase is attributed to higher freight and insurance costs, as well as rising debt service payments.\nCapital account. Net long-term capital inflow in 1978 was approximately $379 million, an increase of 12 percent over the previous year. Estimates of short-term capital flight, which increased in the second half of 1978, are being reformulated at this time. Until mid-December the Central Bank projected a net deficit in the short-term capital account of $141 million. By the first week of January this estimate had been revised downward by $60 million to $80 million, resulting in a figure which seems unrealistic to US. Both the IMF and the Central Bank are now checking for errors in the latest calculations.\nNet balance and international reserves: The deficit in the balance of payments for 1979 is estimated by the Central Bank to be between $120 and $130 million. The Central Bank will reportedly end the year with net international reserves of approximately $162 million, and the international reserves of the consolidated banking system will be about $60 million. These figures, obtained from the Central Bank January 3, 1979, appear to reflect some short-term year-end borrowing which may have been specifically designed to inflate reserves.\nPublic sector deficit: The total deficit of Bolivia’s public sector for 1978 will be between $450 and $500 million. A high level of investment by the state enterprises (investments exceeded $550 million in 1977) continued in 1978, despite a shift in their current account balance from a surplus of $50 million in 1977 to a deficit of approximately $35 million the following year. During 1978, Central Bank credit to the public sector increased by 93 percent as compared with 1977. The IMF (which places the deficit at $469 million) estimates that the public sector deficit equalled 11.4 percent of GDP. According to the IMF, 65 percent ($304 million) of the deficit was financed with foreign credits.\nDebt and debt service: Bolivia’s disbursed external debt is estimated by the IMF to have increased by 23 percent in 1978 to $1.797 billion. The debt service ratio for the year was 28.9 percent. If no refinancing is done in 1979, the debt service ratio will rise to at least 34 percent ($250 million). Not only is the magnitude of Bolivia’s debt increasing with discouraging rapidity, the terms of the debt are hardening, and foreign borrowings are being used to cover current expenses, including tax payments to the Central Government by the public corporations.\nInflation: According to official statistics, inflation was held to 18 percent in 1978. This relatively reasonable rate is explained by the relatively low growth in the money supply (M2) (9 percent), which is in turn accounted for by the heavy demand for foreign currency and the consequent decline in international reserves.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1979LAPAZ00230\nDate: January 09, 1979\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 jan 1960\nConcepts: ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT"

First, the Government of Air Force General Juan Pereda proved to be short-lived: it was deposed on November 24, 1978, by a military junta headed by Army General David Padilla. The Padilla government promptly declared general elections for July 1, 1979, setting August 6 as the date of transferring power to the new constitutional government. Second, the economy, which began to decline toward the end of the Banzer regime, has, under Pereda and Padilla, deteriorated exponentially. Padilla has been reluctant to implement necessary corrective measures for two reasons: (1) he fears that attendant social unrest could threaten the electoral timetable, and (2) he does not want to invite popular criticism of the armed forces. Despite the deepening economic crisis, Padilla and his colleagues have been careful not to sacrifice their institutional interests. Aware that funds are in ever shorter supply, they are determined to purchase necessary military equipment before surrendering power on August 6. In our view, at least some of these purchases, although hardly timely, may be necessary. In the past several years, Bolivia's armed forces have been undersupplied and underequipped. Withdrawing from the government, they will require new equipment in order to recoup the professional esprit that has atrophied in recent years. Finally, although the threat of conflict between Chile and Peru has diminished, top commanders still worry that Bolivia's borders can be violated with impunity. This perception impels them to refurbish their inventories. Justified or not, they are not likely to feel secure until they have done so.\n\n3. **US Interests/Objectives:**\nA. The security assistance program is directly tied to the pivotal United States' interest of maintaining stability in the Andean region. In addition, the program helps develop interpersonal relationships between US and Bolivian officers. Such relationships facilitate valuable exchanges of views and serve as a conduit for expressions of US interest in matters such as democratization, respect for human rights, arms control and the reduction of tension in the Andean region. Finally, security assistance complements programs in support of economic development and helps sustain an environment in which the US has access to domestic raw materials and in which US products may be marketed competitively.\nB. Security assistance objectives are postulated on the maintenance of a constructive relationship with the Bolivian military. They entail encouraging the military: (1) to display restraint and moderation in its renovation efforts; (2) to continue to emphasize its nation-building and civic action roles; and (3) to respect human rights and the democratic development process. Within this context, we must remain responsive to requests for assistance in acquiring reasonable amounts of military equipment and be able to provide appropriate CZ and CONUS training for armed forces personnel.\n\n4. **External/Internal Threats:** The likelihood of conflict between Chile and Argentina over the Beagle Channel issue appears to have diminished significantly in the past few months; similarly, nearly halfway through the centenary year of the War of the Pacific, a Peruvian attack against Chile seems most improbable. Nonetheless, the specter of such conflicts, however unlikely, has made a strong impression on the Bolivian military. Whatever strategies the potential combatants may consider, Bolivian officers view their national boundaries as all but defenseless. They are acutely aware that since gaining independence in 1825, Bolivia has lost territory to all five neighboring countries. With a land area approximately twice that of France and with a population of less than five million, they need not resort to sophisticated analysis to demonstrate that it remains vulnerable to armed incursion and cultural encroachment.\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1979LAPAZ04058\nDate: May 09, 1979\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 jan 1960\nConcepts: ANNUAL REPORTS, MILITARY ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS"

The trade unions, eager to avoid strikes that could jeopardize the democratization process, have been moderate in their wage demands, which the business sector and the GOB have been willing to accommodate. The result has been 14 months of relative labor peace. While most observers expect quiescence to continue through the July elections, there are three factors that could destabilize the situation: (A) increasing pressure from the rank and file for additional wage increases because of the rising rate of inflation; (B) a public posture by the GOB not to grant any wage increases to public sector employees and leave this question to the incoming elected government; and (C) the upcoming (May 1) congress of the Bolivian Workers Center (COB) and the possibility that longtime COB leader Juan Lechin Oquendo might try to provoke labor agitation in order to enhance his reelection bid. Nevertheless, with labor’s wanting to avoid any disruption of the democratization process, the chances of avoiding serious strikes appear to be reasonably good. End summary.\nDuring the first ten weeks of 1979, the relatively tranquil state of labor-management relations that prevailed in Bolivia during 1978 has continued. As discussed in the 1978 Annual Labor Report (REFAIR), the Bolivian labor movement, having been badly burned by the suspension of labor freedoms from 1974 to 1978 under the Banzer regime, has been a strong supporter of the democratization process and the return of elected civilian government. Accordingly, in order to avoid possibly disruptive strikes that could jeopardize this process, the unions have been deliberately modest in their wage demands.\nIn turn, the private sector has been forthcoming in its willingness to accommodate these demands. Bolivian entrepreneurs have recognized that the workers have been caught in an inflationary squeeze (with inflation running at 18 percent in 1978 and around 30 percent (annual rate) thus far this year, according to informed sources), and they have responded with wage increases that have compensated the workers in full or in large part for losses in purchasing power.\nIn the public sector, both the Pereda and Padilla administrations have pursued a similarly moderate wage policy. The result has been that in the 14 months since labor freedoms were restored in January 1978, there has not been a single major strike in Bolivia, and what strikes and work stoppages that have occurred have been few and of short duration.\nAlthough most leaders and observers in both the labor and business sectors believe that this relative stability will continue through July 1, there are a few problems ahead.\nThe great majority of labor leaders remain as committed as before to the democratization process, but they are feeling increasing pressure from the rank and file to obtain additional wage increases this year to compensate for the sharply increased rate of inflation.\nNevertheless, this pressure may not necessarily present insurmountable problems in the private sector because business leaders in most cases appear to be prepared to negotiate wage increases sufficient to meet at least the minimum demands of the rank and file.\nNegotiations are presently continuing with the factory workers and construction workers confederations. The issue in the former case is not salary (at least not yet), but whether the wage increase to be granted should be negotiated between the Chamber of Industry and the Labor Confederation (labor’s position) or between each individual factory and its union (business’s position). Although both sides appear to want to avoid a strike, negotiations have been prolonged and patience may be drawing short. A prolonged strike, though, would appear unlikely.\nThe situation in the public sector may be somewhat more difficult because in February President Padilla announced that the GOB would be unable to grant any wage increases to government employees due to the economic problems facing the country. Requests for wage increases would have to be decided by the civilian government taking office on August 6. Amazingly, a secret salary increase granted by Padilla to military officers has not become generally known.\nNevertheless, there may be some flexibility in the GOB’s position. Bolivia’s two teacher confederations have been trying to negotiate a wage increase for months, but the Minister of Education, Colonel Jose Olvis (who may be on his way out), has refused to discuss the issue and has simply reiterated the GOB’s public position on public sector wage increases. However, President Padilla, according to the leader of the La Paz Urban Teachers Federation, met with the teachers before departing on his trip to Venezuela and Brazil and told them that he would resolve the problem in their favor on his return to Bolivia. The teachers appear eager to avoid a strike and thus some solution appears probable.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1979LAPAZ02347\nDate: March 16, 1979\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 jan 1960\nConcepts: LABOR, PEACE, ELECTIONS"

Private businessmen in Santa Cruz have pledged approximately $500,000 of the $3.5 million Paz estimates is necessary to run his campaign, and the private sector has also agreed to pay the expenses of Santa Cruz delegates to the MNR convention in La Paz.\nThe consensus among political parties and business leaders at the moment is that ex-President Banzer will not become a presidential candidate. Most believe that the majority of the supporters of the ex-President are disposed to back Victor Paz. End Summary.\nWith the emergence of the Victor Paz Estenssoro presidential candidacy seemingly assured, and divisions appearing in the UDP coalition, the political atmosphere in Santa Cruz has calmed considerably during the past three weeks. Paz met personally with prominent Santa Cruz businessmen before travelling to La Paz for the MNR convention, and according to a participant in that meeting, approximately $500,000 was pledged to the Paz campaign. The MNR leadership is said to have discussed agricultural policy at some length with the Santa Cruz cattlemen and major farmers and to have made commitments regarding the agricultural policies that would be followed by a Paz government.\nWhen asked by an Embassy officer about the prospects for broadening the party’s support in the Santa Cruz area, local MNR leaders made it clear that they are opening the doors, albeit quietly, to the followers of ex-President Hugo Banzer. Although denying direct contact with either Banzer or his advisers, MNR officials said they expect support from this quarter because they intend to make it known that an MNR government would concentrate on dealing with problems at hand rather than dwelling on the past. (Comment: This approach is obviously designed to reassure those who would not welcome an investigation of their performance as members of the Banzer government.)\nAccording to an adviser and relative of ex-President Banzer, the former president does not now intend to participate as a candidate in the coming elections. Asked whom Banzer followers might be expected to support, the source commented that they would probably back Paz, although he inferred this might be done indirectly via General Bernal and the PDC. He added that at this point whatever risks might be entailed in carrying out the electoral process seem preferable to the certain reaction that would follow a cancellation or unwarranted postponement of elections.\nAs might be expected, leaders of the Falange (FSB) in Santa Cruz claim to be confident of victory in the July elections. Outlining a strategy which calls for strong attacks on Victor Paz and his policies as President of Bolivia, FSB representatives explained that they plan to polarize the electorate by showing that there is no political difference between Paz and Siles Zuazo. Having identified these two candidates in the minds of the voters, the FSB expects both the military and the Santa Cruz region to find Paz “as unacceptable as Siles.” At this point the field would be clear for the FSB candidate, Mario Gutierrez. (Comment: Although Santa Cruz remains a stronghold of the FSB on the local level, i.e., FSB candidates are routinely elected to the powerful Pro-Santa Cruz Committee, and serve as Rector of the University, etc., non-FSB political observers in the area find the above scenario implausible. The FSB is not thought to be in a strong position to attack Paz, as it entered into an alliance with the MNR of Paz in 1971. In addition, FSB support outside Santa Cruz – particularly in rural areas – is considered weak. The influential private sector of the region, whose support would be essential to the FSB, does not believe the party or its presidential candidate have significant national appeal, and the lion’s share of the campaign contributions from businessmen is being committed to Paz Estenssoro.)\nConclusions: So long as the Paz candidacy appears viable, and he seems to have a reasonable chance of victory, support in Santa Cruz for the electoral process is likely to remain relatively firm. However, given the deep animosity among influential political and economic groups in the Santa Cruz area toward the UDP (and antipathy toward Siles Zuazo dating back to the late 1950s), should Siles Zuazo at some point in the campaign appear to be a probable victor, pro-election sentiment in Santa Cruz could evaporate rapidly. If the UDP coalition wins the elections, it will be faced with formidable opposition in the Santa Cruz department.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1979LAPAZ01225\nDate: February 08, 1979\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 jan 1960\nConcepts: ELECTIONS, POLITICAL SITUATION"

He said that at present prices for sales, Bolivia will be paying $2 million a month to Gulf and thus will liquidate remaining approximately $70 million of debt in three or four years. Minister said that government is receiving criticism in several quarters for maintaining rates of payment to Gulf in face of desperate need for use of these resources for budgetary and investment purposes. While he realized government could defend itself to some extent by asserting that percentage arrangement was beneficial to Bolivia in event production and sales declined, this argument hardly satisfies solicitants for increased budgetary allocations under present high world prices of petroleum. According to Minister, Gulf has offered to accept lump sum payment at somewhat smaller amount, but this would place GOB in position of having to negotiate commercial bank credit over short period at high interest rates. Minister Jimenez said that Bolivian representatives had put several alternatives forward to Gulf which is expected to respond within a week or so. Minister not optimistic that Gulf will accept any of these alternatives and hence asked for USG “good offices” so as to free up sorely needed funds for current uses now being derived from high petroleum prices. Minister was well briefed on conversation reported in State 034718 but asked us to reconsider position outlined by BC Deputy Director Lowenthal.\nI indicated that our position at the moment was not to become involved in rescheduling negotiations, but in view of Minister’s earnest request to me, I would pass on to Washington by telegram his request and solicit a Washington comment.\nIn La Paz 1277 it was requested that Dept. might wish to obtain from Gulf estimates of current payments at existing prices so as to clarify the facts of on-going GOB payments to Gulf. As was mentioned in La Paz 1277, if high levels of payments to Gulf are correct, Embassy estimate of 1974 balance of payments surplus would fall from a forecasted $11.4 million to a deficit of $6.9 million. If this is so, it may very well be in USG interest to consider extending “good offices” so as to facilitate over the near term proceeds from GE and petroleum sales for domestic investment needs.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1974LAPAZ01515\nDate: March 12, 1974\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 JAN 1960\nConcepts: PETROLEUM, SALES, BALANCE OF PAYMENTS, BUDGET DEFICITS, PRICE TRENDS, FOREIGN POLICY POSITION,"

THE SETTING\n        \n            \n    \n    \n  \n\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE TELEGRAM\nUNCLASSIFIED\n\nBolivia is now trying to emerge from a two-year period of political turbulence, short-lived and ineffective governments, economic decline and intense military-civilian tension. The most consistent trends during this period have been broad popular pressure for civilian government and growing anti-military sentiment, culminating in the strident repudiation and undoing of the Natusch coup and installation of the Gueiler government in November 1979.\nUS-Bolivian relations are excellent and US prestige in the country has reached a new high, primarily because the US in both good times and bad (the Natusch coup) has been consistently on the right side of the popular ground swell for human rights and civilian, representative government. Our support in the OAS for Bolivia’s aspiration for access to the Pacific has also added significantly to US prestige here. Our relationship with the military has weakened concomitantly because of our association with the tarnished respectability and political decline of military government and because of the supplanting of US training and orientation by the much harder line of Argentine military institutions in particular.\nThe sharp cuts in the FY 80 aid program have threatened the image of the US as a provider of significant economic support for Bolivia, at a time when the government is courageously and successfully laying the financial policy base for renewed development momentum. At the same time the highly successful PL-480 Title III program has proved an ideal developmental and political instrument for the Bolivian environment (and has been widely publicized by USICA and Bolivian media). On the other hand, prolonged US consideration of GSA tin disposals has been and will remain the most volatile and negative factor in the US-Bolivian relationship as Bolivia enters an election campaign and continues efforts to consolidate civilian government.\nThe near-term prospects for that consolidation remain precarious as a weak, if determined, Gueiler government enforces an unpopular economic stabilization program and tries to guide an uncertain and possibly turbulent electoral process. The longer-term prognosis is brighter, both economically and politically.\n\nB. Bilateral Issues\n\nThe three areas of weakness in the US-Bolivian relationship remain our so-far inadequate response to Bolivia’s current economic plight, weak US influence on the military, and backlash to current US policy on tin disposals.\nAs Bolivia tries to emerge from virtual financial insolvency the PL-480 Title III program has been a most effective and widely applauded instrument of US support. We should now take advantage of the program’s strong development record to increase the FY 80 allocation and thereby the short-term financial impact. This will both allow the government to maintain a higher level of investment in rural areas and help relieve the severe foreign exchange bind. As political stability increases the government’s ability to administer additional project funds, this important program to achieve longer term economic strength and structural reform should increase accordingly.\nAs our IMET levels have declined over the last decade, so has the influence of the US and US ideals in a Bolivian military which desperately needs reorientation toward an apolitical and military professional role. Some blame the US counter insurgency doctrine of the 60s for the Bolivian military’s fixation with imaginary internal security problems, but this is pure scapegoat seeking. In fact, the military’s interventionism pre-dates our training programs and our more recent inability to finance training in the US has coincided with the evolution of arrogant and power-hungry attitudes in a faction of the officer corps. Increased IMET to finance military training in the US would not in itself solve the problem of military reorientation, but it would contribute importantly to parallel Bolivian efforts.\nThe most persistently negative issue in bilateral relations remains US tin disposals. Over the past two years continuing Congressional consideration of a disposal authorization, even in the absence of actual sales, has produced constant abrasion in an otherwise smooth bilateral relationship. When disposals are authorized, we need to sell modest regular monthly\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1979LAPAZ10719\nDate: December 18, 1979\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 jan 1960\nConcepts: ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, FOREIGN POLICY POSITION, INTELLIGENCE ASSESSMENTS, POLITICAL SITUATION"

We unable get definite information from MININD/COM officials who say Subsecretary Zamorano is only official who has facts on this matter at his command. Zamorano has been out of La Paz.\nWith reference para 2 ref A, GOB decision mill flour in Arequipa not a premeditated conscious violation of PL-480 regulations, during which GOB could take into consideration purchase of flour from U.S. GOB decision was taken in emergency situation created by a) Peruvian Southern Railway strike, b) need obtain storage space at Matarani for incoming shipments, and c) need insure adequate flour supply to La Paz at time when local mills were unable meet demand due their limited capacity and usual supply of flour from Argentina was not forthcoming. In these unforeseen and probably unforeseeable circumstances, we do not see that there is a U.S. domestic issue raised.\nWe have serious reservations about telling MININD/COM, at this time at least, that his action to mill PL-480 wheat in Peru will automatically convert PL-480 purchase to commercial purchase. Bolivia is now undergoing great stress from GOB decisions to increase control prices on basic food items by more than 100 percent (see ref B). Street demonstrations, store break-ins and attempts, kidnapping of police officers, dynamitings, exchanges of gun fire with injuries between police and crowds have all occurred over the last few days. GOB feels none too secure. GOB also unhappy and shaken by USG decision not grant further PL-480 this FY and USG advice to not count on PL-480 for FY 1975. MININD/COM has already shown tendency to try to put as much blame for his present wheat and flour troubles on USG as he can (see ref C). We believe USG could come in for major public accusations that it is responsible for world wheat shortage, high wheat prices, and withdrawal of badly needed support at critical time if this situation is not handled carefully. Moreover, conversion to commercial sale would deny GOB about $20 million in generations which sorely needed. As ref A ignores 1) transport problems in moving wheat from Matarani to La Paz, etc., and transport and other problems in moving Argentine flour to Bolivia and 2) important factors presented in paras 3 and 4 above, request instruction ref A be carefully reconsidered.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1974LAPAZ00526\nDate: January 24, 1974\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 JAN 1960\nConcepts: WHEAT, PROCUREMENT, FOOD SHORTAGE, PUBLIC DEMONSTRATIONS, ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE, PL 480 TITLE 1,"

Turnout appears to have been heavy. These may well be the cleanest elections in Bolivia’s history, as promised by the Padilla regime from its inception last November.\nConagents in Cochabamba and Santa Cruz confirm for their areas what we have heard officially from the Ministry of the Interior as being the situation throughout the country, that the whole process has been peaceful and orderly with only a few incidents of no political significance being reported.\nAccording to unofficial results, as of 2300 hours local time July 1, some 578,000 votes had been counted (31 per cent) of the total registered vote. The breakdown is as follows:\nA. Hernan Siles Zuazo (UDP) - 199,000 (34 percent) B. Victor Paz Estenssoro (MNR) - 150,000 (26 per cent) C. Hugo Banzer Suarez (ADN) - 133,000 (23 per cent) D. Marcel Quiroga Santa Cruz (PS) - 52,000 (9 per cent) E. Rene Bernal Escalante (APIN) - 28,000 (5 per cent)\nIn the city of La Paz, Siles is leading with 43 per cent of the vote, to win handily in the department, but the big surprise is Banzer’s lead over Paz in the city itself.\nElsewhere in the Altiplano (Highlands), early returns are as follows:\nA. Oruro - Paz has a narrow lead over Siles (29-28 pct) overall. Final results show that Paz captured the capital city with 30 pct, but most of the countryside vote has not yet come in and could well give the department ultimately to Siles. Bernal appears not to have been a factor in his home department.\nB. Cochabamba - With results thus far only from the city of Cochabamba, Banzer is leading Siles 17,304 to 16,268 with Quiroga Santa Cruz having won 14,506. Paz is fourth with 7,155. With about 20 pct of the countryside vote in, Siles is leading Paz 33 pct to 27 pct with Banzer in third place with 13 pct.\nC. Chuquisaca - Final results from the city of Sucre show Siles won 52 pct followed by Banzer with 14 pct and Paz with 11.5 pct. No results are in yet from the countryside.\nD. Potosi - Siles has a narrow edge over Paz, 41 pct to 39 pct with about 60 pct of the city vote in. Scattered returns from the countryside show both Paz and Siles doing well but with no pattern yet apparent. None of the other candidates appears to be a factor in this department.\nIn the eastern departments of Beni, Santa Cruz, Pando, and Tarija, Paz is, as expected, doing very well, and Banzer surprisingly is beating out Siles for second place. In the Pando, final results from the capital city Cobija show Paz winning 42 pct to Banzer’s 33 pct and Siles’ 20 pct. In Santa Cruz, Paz is leading in the capital city by 36 pct to 34 pct over Banzer, and apparently doing even better in the countryside. With returns from only three towns, Paz’ majorities range from 53 pct to 67 pct. In Paz’ home department of Tarija, he was leading in the capital city with 43 pct, and in the countryside with 65 pct of the vote. Finally, in the Beni, with an estimated 55 pct of the total vote in, Paz was leading Banzer 41 pct to 31 pct, with Siles in third place (17 pct).\nAccording to officials of the Permanent Assembly on Human Rights (PAHR), there have been very few incidents of fraud or violence thus far reported. The only incident of violence reported involved the theft of three voting boxes Saturday night in the department of Beni. Allegations of fraud have also been few, and, according to the PAHR, minor. The only incident of any importance involved the nullification of the results at two voting stations in Beni because of “irregularities.” All radio broadcasts thus far monitored support the impression the election day 1979 was remarkably tranquil throughout the country.\nComment: The major surprise thus far is Banzer’s strength manifested by early returns. This may wane somewhat, however, as returns from the provinces of Potosi, Cochabamba, Oruro and Chuquisaca departments come in where Banzer is generally much less influential. The above overall percentages will therefore fluctuate (somewhat) until the final returns come in, but it would appear at this time that Siles will win his plurality, but not big, and certainly not the majority of the popular vote.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1979LAPAZ05655\nDate: July 02, 1979\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 jan 1960\nConcepts: ELECTION RESULTS"

Gen Eden Castillo, Armed Forces Commander, is heading that delegation. COB Secretary General Juan Lechin along with his Deputy Oscar Sanjines, Congressman Simon Reyes and other Executive Committee members represent labor, and the Congress is represented by each chamber’s officers as well as the parties’ respective floor leaders. The current focus appears to remain on the idea of a governing triumvirate whereby a member of Congress, labor, and the Armed Forces would form Bolivia’s executive. Thus far the COB and the Congress have resoundingly rejected Col. Natusch as the Armed Forces’ representative in such an arrangement, which in turn has caused the military to take the position that if the COB and the Congress can elect their own to the triumvirate, then the Armed Forces should be no less entitled to do the same. The impasse, then, is over Natusch. According to one MNR source, a sounding of the Armed Forces garrisons in La Paz and the interior reveals an overwhelming sentiment that Natusch continue. This appears borne out by Alfredo Arce, close Banzer advisor, who informs us that events are moving closer to a purely military (castrense) solution. Arce – who earlier in the day (November 12) noted that Banzer is in town – also mentioned “consultations” with the garrisons, which he characterized more as briefing sessions than soundings, but with the same result, i.e., total support for Natusch. Hence, Arce noted, if the Congress and the COB continue to hold out against Natusch in the current negotiations over the triumvirate, then the Armed Forces will simply end the discussion and effectively suspend the Congress. This would not preclude civilians in the cabinet and other positions, he suggested, but the conclusion is that civilian participants would come largely from Banzer’s and coalition which Arce confirmed is now supporting the regime.\nIn the meantime, the Natusch government has embarked on a rather tortured campaign to put the best face on the November 1 takeover. Natusch himself took pains to explain on television and in the press that the putsch was not just a military movement but one that was civic and political in character as well. He reiterated previous promises to readjust salaries without devaluation; to incorporate workers in the management of state enterprises; to seek an equilibrium between capital and labor; and to consolidate the process of democratization. With respect to the United States, Natusch noted his government’s “respect and admiration for the people of the United States,” but referring to the U.S. decision to “freeze” economic aid to Bolivia, Natusch expressed doubts this would be carried out, since “it would constitute an outrage (atentado) against the Bolivian people rather than the present government.”\nAlong the same vein, Foreign Minister Guillermo Bedregal – also on television and in the press – emphasized that “the revolutionary movement of November 1 1979 from the very initial gestation period counted upon the knowledge, acquiescence, and support”of” Victor Paz. According to Bedregal, the MNR and MNRI were “united in this struggle together with the Armed Forces; Paz Estenssoro was in agreement with this solution….”\nFinally, a mass was held Monday morning in the San Francisco Church facing one of La Paz’ main squares for the dead of last weeks’ conflagration. Former Presidents Walter Guevara Arze and Hernan Siles were among those attending.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1979LAPAZ09725\nDate: November 13, 1979\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 jan 1960\nConcepts: ARMED FORCES, LABOR, LEGISLATORS, POLITICAL SETTLEMENT, NEGOTIATIONS"

His office promised to have him telephone Embassy immediately upon his return.\nComment: We are in complete accord with Department’s desire that the USG’s role in this case be essentially that of honest broker and are satisfied that the GOB officials concerned with this dispute so regard us. When Capt. Sanchez was informed of substance of Ref D, he seemed more appreciative of the demonstration of the USG’s willingness to act as an honest broker than disturbed by what he clearly understood to be merely an initial and fragmentary report. We are confident that the GOB continues to regard settlement of the Farmabol dispute as in its interest and continues to see Atty. Hathorn’s packages as a promising vehicle for resolution. (Obviously, confirmation of our impression must await Sanchez’ return.) Clearly, however, Hathorn’s packages must stand on their own merits.\nAs Department is aware, Atty. Hathorn came to Bolivia with three arrows in his quiver: A) Settle the Farmabol dispute; B) Offer the Dominick & Dominick loan, and C) offer the complex “fiduciary deposit” loan package described in La Paz 7639 and La Paz 7614. As reported in our A-268, Hathorn said the loans and the Farmabol settlement need not be directly tied together. While here, he clearly gave impression that he was more interested in arranging the “fiduciary deposit” loan package than either or both of the other matters. Moreover, Hathorn said purpose of his December trip here was to establish parameters of discussion. He left satisfied he had done so and clearly aware that next step would be satisfaction of GOB’s inquiries about his own, his firm’s and his backers antecedents and bona fides.\nDepartment will recall that GOB was embarrassed last summer by a $US 225 million loan offer (among several others) that could not be closed after public announcement. If for no other reason, GOB officials would today approach any package with healthy caution which we feel should be encouraged and which, to the extent that U.S. citizens are involved, we feel we should help satisfy.\nOn the other hand, while we are indeed anxious to see Farmabol dispute resolved, we do not feel that Atty. Hathorn’s packages constitute only opportunity history will offer. Capt. Sanchez was the only GOB official informed of Ref D and we believe he should continue to be the channel of information, any other approach, in our view, would put USG in the position of seemingly endorsing a specific transaction. End comment.\nAction requested: Ref. C reported Dominick & Dominick President Kennedy said quote he would be aware of a transaction of this magnitude end quote and also reported that Dominick & Dominick’s S.A. Megeath quote confirmed Hathorn was authorized to propose $US 15 million transaction to GOB end quote. To close circle, Department is requested to seek confirmation from Kennedy that Megeath is empowered to commit Dominick & Dominick in this matter.

POLITICIANS IN BOLIVIA AT THIS TIME HAVE NEITHER THE DESIRE TO ALIENATE THE PUBLIC AT LARGE NOR THE CLOUT TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THE PRESIDENT STAYS IN OFFICE.\nTHE EMBASSY DOES NOT WISH TO SUGGEST THAT THE ARMY IS SOLIDLY BEHIND BANZER.

IT MAY EVEN BE LESS SOLIDLY BEHIND THE PRESIDENT NOW THAN A FEW MONTHS AGO BECAUSE THERE HAS BEEN, AFTER ALL,\n\n292338Z\nRATHER WIDE-SPREAD CRITICISM OF THE WAY THE GOV HAS HANDLED\nNATIONAL ECONOMIC PROBLEMS SINCE LAST OCTOBER. ON THE OTHER HAND, IT IS HIGHLY IMPROBABLE THAT GENERAL ALCOREZA WOULD HAVE TOLD A LARGE GROUP OF CADETS THAT THE ARMY WOULD DUMP BANZER IF HE APPEARS TO LOSE SUPPORT, AS STATED IN REFTEL.\n\nTHE EMBASSY AGREES THAT THERE MAY BE GROWING SENTIMENTS WITHIN THE MILITARY FOR A CHANGE IN THE PRESIDENCY. THE EMBASSY HAS REPORTED THE RATHER PERSISTENT TALK ABOUT THE PROSPECTS OF A MILITARY JUNTA OR AN ALL-MILITARY CABINET. HOWEVER, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THIS IS THE TIME FOR EITHER, BECAUSE NEITHER WOULD BE ABLE TO PRESENT NEW SOLUTIONS TO THE EXISTING PROBLEMS. THE MILITARY DOES NOT WISH TO BEAR THE FULL BRUNT OF GENERAL CRITICISM AND IS UNLIKELY TO PUT ITSELF IN THIS POSITION. ALSO REPORTED IN THE PAST HAS BEEN THE EXTRAORDINARY EFFECTIVENESS OF THE GOB IN DISCOVERING AND CRUSHING COUP PLOTS.\nIN SUM, THE GOB IS FACING PROBLEMS AT THIS TIME AS THE DEPARTMENT KNOWS, BUT WE BELIEVE BANZER’S SURVIVAL PROSPECTS CONTINUE TO BE GOOD.

(In terms of total U.S. tractor exports, impact would be negligible.) They are not inclined to protest to GOB. Most believe that greatest gains in tractor sales will be above 112 h.p. maximum reserved for Fiat. We concur large farmers with good credit standing are now looking for bigger tractors.\nWe agree with Reftel assessment of applicability of treaty provisions. We also believe that Fiat arrangement can set precedent for further monopoly arrangements. U.S. firm, Dresser, may be next firm to receive such monopoly. We understand Dresser investment contract has been signed but decree similar to one issued in Fiat case has not been issued thus far to cover Dresser investment.\nSimilar cases may have arisen possibly on basis of GATT obligation if not FCN treaties in other Andean Pact or still other countries on de facto basis if not de jure. Department in best position to judge importance of this case as precedent.\nWe believe approach probably advisable on grounds this case may set significant new precedent in Bolivia at least. Following factors, however, should be taken into consideration: (a) If similar cases have occurred in other countries, multilateral approach should be considered. (b) Must be borne in mind that GOB may simply respond that U.S. firm, Dresser, will be favored in same degree as Fiat. (c) GOB may refer to exception USG requested in 1946 to reciprocal MFN for U.S. - Philippine trade which GOB readily granted. Thus, GOB could ask for exchange of notes waiving MFN for six year period provided for in Fiat arrangement.\nIf Department believes an approach advisable, we would propose an initial approach to Subsecretary for Industry Pereira who at right level and most knowledgeable GOB official on Andean Pact ramifications. Fiat investment made in hopes of obtaining Andean Pact programmed industrial sector assignment and Dresser investment being made in subsector already assigned to Bolivia under Andean Pact.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1974LAPAZ02611\nDate: April 24, 1974\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 JAN 1960\nConcepts: TREATY VIOLATION, FARM EQUIPMENT, TRADE AGREEMENTS, TRACTORS, IMPORT CONTROLS, MONOPOLIES"

Also, the delegation did invite several members from the Bolivian Cotton Producers Association, ADEPA, to visit the PRC in the immediate future.\nComment: Recent, severe flooding had an adverse impact on Bolivia’s 1979 cotton crop.

The IMF and the GOB agreed that the package of economic measures must include an immediate increase in the domestic price of petroleum products and some form of devaluation. The IMF has stated that it can send a mission to Bolivia within a few days of receipt of the GOB’s invitation. Possible obstacles are the GOB’s insistence that it needs about $US 50 million prior to the negotiations, so it will not be negotiating under the gun of imminent reserve exhaustion, and the risk that wage pressures will surge beyond what the GOB can offer in the context of a coherent program. End summary.\nAt his own initiative, returning from Uruguay, Marcelo Caiola of the Western Hemisphere Division of the IMF, arrived in La Paz August 22 and spent three days discreetly visiting with GOB officials. Caiola held the following meetings:\n\nA. Enrique Garcia, President of the Central Bank;\nB. Guido Hinojosa, Minister of Finance and Carlos Miranda, Minister of Planning and Coordination;\nC. The President’s economic cabinet–Carlos Miranda, Guido Hinojosa, Tommas Guillermo Elio (Minister of Industry and Commerce), Gustavo Fernandez (Minister of Foreign Relations).\nD. President Walter Guevara. The President, who would normally have attended the economic cabinet meeting, was sick so Caiola and Jorge Sol Perez, the resident IMF representative, visited him at his home.\n\nAccording to Sol Perez, the meetings were most productive but were characterized by a degree of ignorance of international finance on the part of the GOB officials. The economic leadership is made up of people well experienced in rural development, project financing, and integration but not international finance. After the candid discussion, the GOB decided in favor of economic measures and negotiations with the IMF. President Guevara Arze, in consonance with what he termed his implicit mandate from Congress to address the economic situation, followed the discussions closely and ultimately agreed that the GOB must negotiate with the IMF.\nCurrent Situation: Bolivia’s financial situation grows more serious each day. On August 29, the Central Bank’s net reserves totaled $US 49 million. Apparently, this included about $US 10 million in German credits for the Karachipampa Lead and Silver Smelter Project. In addition, the Central Bank has about $US 100 million in the “Depositos Al Terceros,” which are foreign exchange deposits of the state enterprises and commercial banks held in the Central Bank. Normally, with good monetary management, the Central Bank would not use these deposits, but recently the Bolivian Central Bank has dipped into them to meet their foreign exchange demands. The Central Bank also has about $US 50 million in credit lines with New York banks which have not been used. If necessary, both the “Depositos Al Terceros” and the bank credit lines could be drawn down.\n\nA. Presently, Bolivia’s average daily foreign exchange transaction loss is running about $US 2 million. Some days’ losses have been much higher. On Monday, August 27, triggered by an interview with Central Bank President Enrique Garcia published in Saturday’s newspapers, losses approached $US 8 million. Even assuming minimum reserve losses of $US 2 million daily, the Central Bank’s net reserve position would turn negative before the end of September.\nB. From now through the end of the year, Bolivia must pay about $US 244 million in debt service, according to Sol Perez. This includes $US 100 million in amortization and interest for various loans to the GOB and $US 144 million to repay the Central Bank swaps obtained by the GOB in June.\nC. Gross Central Bank reserves totaled $US 236.7 million on August 20 as compared with $US 215.2 million on June 30. Net reserves on June 30 were $US 82.04 million. Net domestic credit expanded from $US 440.86 million on June 30 to $US 509.3 million on August 20. The money supply increased by 7 percent to $US 321.3 million from June 30 to August 20. Through July, imports were increasing at a rate almost 40 percent over that of last year.\nD. Sol Perez states that Bolivia’s consolidated public sector deficit is enormous and without any measures will approach $US 580 million by the end of the year. Even if public sector revenues were increased via tax increases, better customs enforcement, and price increases of state enterprise produced goods, the fiscal gap could not be closed. The GOB currently finances about one-half of this deficit with short-term credits.\n\nMeasures: After talking with IMF officials, the GOB opted for the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) instead of a one year standby agreement, which would provide less than $US 100 million in financing.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1979LAPAZ07471\nDate: August 31, 1979\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 20 Mar 2014\nConcepts: MEETINGS, ECONOMIC PROGRAMS"

ORMACHEA SAID MOST OF REORGANIZATION WAS HIS IDEA AND HAD BEEN ACCEPTED BY MINISTER FOR COORDINATION LECHIN.\nORMACHEA SAID MINISTER FOR COORDINATION WOULD SOON HAVE THREE SUBSECRETARIES: MACROECONOMIC PLANNING, COORDINATION, AND DECREE PREPARATION. (LATTER WOULD TAKE OVER RESPONSIBILITIES OF SECRETARY GENERAL TO THE PRESIDENCY). SUBSECRETARY FOR MACROECONOMIC PLANNING WOULD WORK OUT OVERALL DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY AND SECTOR INVESTMENT EMPHASES UPON BASIS OF WHICH INITIAL PROJECT PRIORITY RANKING WOULD BE ESTABLISHED.\nPLANNING OFFICES IN EACH MINISTRY WOULD DEVELOP SECTOR AND SUBSECTOR STRATEGIES AND PROJECTS UP TO LEVEL OF PREFEASIBILITY STUDIES.

ORMACHEA REFERRED TO COLUMBIAN GOVERNMENT INSTITUTION, FONADE, AS MODEL BOLIVIANS HAVE IN MIND. (PROBABLY THIS ARISES FROM ADVICE OF OMAR BOTERO, THE FORMER DIRECTOR OF FONADE, WHO HAS VISITED BOLIVIA ON BEHALF OF THE IDB TO GIVE ADVICE TO THE GOB ON THE ESTABLISHMENT OF INDEF.)\nAS STUDIES COMPLETED BY EITHER INALPRE OR STATE ENTERPRISES THEY WOULD BE REFERRED TO INSTITUTO NACIONAL DE FINANCIAMIENTO (SEE LA PAZ A-154, AUG 2, 1974) FOR ARRANGMENT OF FINANCING. ACCORDING TO ORMACHEA, CURRENT PLANS ARE TO DISBURSE SUCH FINANCING TO EXECUTING AGENCY THROUGH CENTRAL BANK AND DCCP. ACCORDING TO ORMACHEA, EACH OF KEY ORGANIZATIONS, LOAN COMMITTEE INDEF AND INALPRE, WILL HAVE SAME KEY MEMBERS (ON THEIR BOARDS IN CASES OF INDEF AND INALPRE) INCLUDING MINISTER OF COORDINATION, MINISTER OF FINANCE, REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PRESIDENCY (PROBABLY GASTON VALLA), PRESIDENT OF THE CENTRAL BANK AND THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS OF INDEF AND INALPRE. ORMACHEA BELIEVES THIS STRUCTURE, TO BE IN PLACE IN TWO OR THREE WEEKS, WILL IMPROVE COORDINATION AND STRENGTHEN PROJECT DEVELOPMENT PROCESS.\nCOMMENT: PLANNED REORGANIZATION APPEARS TO STRENGTHEN POSITION OF MINISTER OF COORDINATION WHO IS ALREADY BEING VISITED AS A KEY OFFICIAL BY FOREIGN BUSINESSMEN CONSIDERING INVESTMENTS OR INVITATIONS TO BID. NEED FOR MORE RAPID DEVELOPMENT OF PUBLIC SECTOR PROJECTS WAS BROUGHT HOME WHEN GOB FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO USE US $25 MILLION BORROWED FROM GROUP OF BANKS LED BY BANK OF AMERICA.

THESE DIVISIONS, HOWEVER, APPEAR TO RESULT FROM POLITICAL AMBITIONS AND PERSONAL LOYALTIES RATHER THAN FROM ANY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN POLITICAL VIEWS. THERE ARE NO SO-CALLED GENERATIONAL GROJP OFFICERS IN THE CABINET, AND THE OVERALL PHILOSOPHICAL CAST OF THE NEW GOB IS CONSERVATIVE. IT IS LIKELY TO PLAY A CARETAKER ROLE IN THE VARIOUS MINISTRIES RATHER THAN ATTEMPT TO LAUNCH BOLD NEW VENTURES.\nPRESIDENT BANZER SHOULD HAVE LITTLE DIFFICULTY IN EXERCISING HIS LEADERSHIP IN THIS CONTEXT AS LONG AS HE\n\n192214Z\nMAINTAINS A DEGREE OF FLEXIBILITY IN HIS DEALINGS WITH THE\nALLEGED FACTIONS WITHIN THE CABINET AND THE HIGH COMMAND OF THE ARMED FORCES. AT THE PRESENT TIME, IT APPEARS TO US THAT BANZER WILL REMAIN IN OFFICE UNTIL SOME SUCCESSION PROCESS, SUCH AS ELECTIONS, IS ARRANGED IN 1975. HE MIGHT BE PRESSURED INTO RESIGNING IN FAVOR OF A MILITARY JUNTA NINETY DAYS OR SO BEFORE ELECTIONS IN ORDER TO ADD TO THE PROSPECTS OF GOVERNMENT IMPARTIALITY IN THE ELECTORAL PROCESS. SO LONG AS BANZER AND HIS CABINET MANAGE WHAT IS NOW GENERALLY VIEWED AS A GOVERNMENT OF TRANSITION, HE IS NOT LIKELY TO CONFRONT ANY SERIOUS OR BROADLY BASED COUP ATTEMPT. HOWEVER, SHOULD IT APPEAR THAT HIS PLANS TO MODIFY THE POLITICAL STRUCTURES OF THE COUNTRY ARE A COVER TO STAY IN OFFICE, OR TO POSTPONE ELECTIONS INDEFINITELY, HE WOULD RUN A GRAVE RISK OF BEING THROWN OUT OF OFFICE.\n\nTHE PROCESS OF RECOMMENDING AND ADOPTING THESE POLITICAL REFORMS IS IMPORTANT, THEREFORE, TO THE STABILITY OF THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT. THERE IS ALREADY GRUMBLING OVER THE NON-WORKING OF THE NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR STRUCTURAL REFORM, AND ITS PREDECESSOR THE NATIONAL CONSULTATIVE COUNCIL(NEVER FORMED, THOUGH ANNOUNCED IN EARLY APRIL), AND THE LENGTHY TIME PERIOD GIVEN TO THE COUNCIL (180 DAYS) TO MAKE ITS RECOMMENDATIONS. SOME PEOPLE ARE NOW SUGGESTING THAT IT WOULD BE MORE DEMOCRATIC, MORE CONSTITUTIONAL AND MORE CONDUCIVE TO POLITICAL TRANQUILITY, TO CALL FOR A CON- STITUENT ASSEMBLY TO PROPOSE AND APPROVE CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS. THESE PEOPLE SUGGEST THAT THE NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR STRUCTURAL REFORM SHOULD BE LIMITED TO PROPOSING THE RULES FOR CONVENING A CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY, WHICH COULD THEN BE CALLED WITHIN A MONTH OR SO. THERE IS ALSO TALK THAT WITHOUT A BROAD POLITICAL AMNESTY AND FREEDOM TO CAMPAIGN POLITICALLY, THE GOVERNMENT’S CREDIBILITY IN FORMING THE ALL-MILITARY CABINET WILL BE SHOT FULL OF HOLES.\nREPORTEDLY, THE SO-CALLED GENERATIONAL GROUP OF OFFICERS LED BY GARY PRADO CONTINUES TO AGITATE FOR BANZER’S REMOVAL AND FOR PROMPT GENERAL ELECTIONS, BUT THE BANZER GOVERNMENT SHOULD HAVE A BREATHING SPELL NOW OF SEVERAL WEEKS BEFORE THE OPPOSITION PRESSURES GROW TO DANGEROUS PROPORTIONS. AS NOTED ABOVE, THESE PRESSURES NEED NOT GROW\n\n192214Z\nUNDULY IF THE GOVERNMENT SHOWS SUFFICIENT SIGNS OF FORWARD MOVEMENT LEADING TO A PROMISED GOVERNMENTAL SUCCESSION.\n\nTHE EMBASSY EXPECTS THAT THE PRESIDENT WILL USE AUGUST 6, INDEPENDENCE DAY, AND AUGUST 7, ARMED FORCES DAY, TO MAKE SOME MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENTS SURROUNDING THE TIME TABLE FOR ELECTIONS AND PERSONNEL CHANGES (E.G., A SHAKE UP IN THE MILITARY AND CHANGES IN THE MINISTRIES AT THE SUB-SECRETARY\n\nLEVEL).\n\nCOMMENT: THE EMBASSY BELIEVES THAT THE FORMATION OF AN ALL-MILITARY CABINET IF IT CARRIES OUT ITS STATED PURPOSE OF GOVERNING DURING A TRANSITIONAL PERIOD LEADING TO NATIONAL ELECTIONS NEXT YEAR SHOULD BENEFIT U.S. INTERESTS IN BOLIVIA. POLITICAL TENSIONS HAVE BEEN LESSENED AND DEMOCRATICALLY ORIENTED POLITICAL GROUPS SHOULD HAVE A CHANCE TO RECOVER THEIR FOLLOWING AND GREATLY REDUCE THE PROSPECTS OF A GOVERNMENTAL TAKE-OVER BY EXTREMIST ELEMENTS. BEFORE THE FORMATION OF THE MILITARY CABINET AND THE ANNOUNCED FORTHCOMING CONSTITUTIONALIZATION OF THE COUNTRY, THE ODDS WERE RISING FOR A COUP BY JUNIOR MILITARY OFFICERS WHO MIGHT HAVE BECOME RADICALIZED IN THEIR QUEST FOR SUPPORT.\nTHE ALL-MILITARY GOVERNMENT WILL ALMOST INEVITABLY LEAD TO SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED MILITARY EXPENDITURES, PRINCIPALLY ON PAY, BENEFITS AND ALLOWANCES SIDE. THE BOLIVIAN ARMED FORCES, LIKE MOST OTHER SECTORS OF BOLIVIAN SOCIETY, ARE IN VERY POOR SHAPE. TO THE EXTENT THAT BETTER PAY AND FACILITIES HELP INSURE THE COHESIVENESS AND LOYALTY OF THE MILITARY UNITS TO THE PRESENT GOB, THE PROSPECTS FOR POLITICAL STABILITY ARE ENHANCED AND OUR OVERALL INTERESTS IN BOLIVIA ADVANCED.

In subsequent days, response to Banzer’s proposal in press and public opinion has been unanimously favorable: In the view of prestigious La Paz daily El Diario, “few political initiatives have been so well received in recent times.” Even opposition politicians such as Christian Democratic Party chief Benjamin Miguel and PRA leader Walter Guevara welcomed the President’s invitation to attend meeting, although both complained that exiled oppositionists such as ex-presidents Paz Estenssoro, Siles Zuazo, Ovando and Torres should also have been permitted to attend.\nSessions of this meeting, called a “National Assembly” by President Banzer, will commence at 10 a.m. on April 5 in Command and General Staff School in Cochabamba. Together with President Banzer, government officials and members of Joint Command of Armed Forces, five former Presidents of Bolivia (David Toro, Mamerto Urriolagoitia, Enrique Hertzog, Hugo Ballivian and Luis Adolfo Siles Salinas) and many former foreign ministers (including Guevara, Alberto Crespo Gutierrez and Mario Gutierrez) will attend meeting, which is expected to conclude on April 6. Banzer will announce results of sessions to nation in a speech to be delivered following closing of conference.\nComment: Consultative meeting in Cochabamba reemphasizes decision by Banzer government, reported in Reftel, to give renewed policy emphasis to century-old theme of “Return to the Sea.” Meeting will also serve government’s goal of uniting diverse strands of domestic political opinion behind this foreign policy issue, while distracting public attention from such pressing internal problems as food shortages and inflation. We expect that government will continue to generate high level of official activity and public debate over access to the sea question until either popular interest wanes or new issues arise to take priority over this familiar theme in Bolivian foreign policy.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1974LAPAZ02065\nDate: April 04, 1974\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 JAN 1960\nConcepts: FOREIGN POLICY POSITION, POLITICAL PARTIES, PUBLIC ATTITUDES, MEETINGS, WATERWAY ACCESS"

AMONG OPPOSITION ELEMENTS WHO CONTRIBUTED TO INCREASED POLITICAL TENSION OF PAST FEW DAYS ARE PRO-VALVERDE FLANGISTAS, LARGE NUMBER OF UNIVERSITY STUDENTS, A GROUP OF JUNIOR AND MIDDLE-GRADE MILITARY OFFICERS, SOME LABOR UNIONS AND VESTIGES OF PDC-PRA-MNRI POLITICAL ALLIANCE. GOVERNMENT IS AWARE OF DANGER IT FACES, AS DEMONSTRATED BY EMERGENCY MEETINGS OF PRESIDENT BANZER WITH MILITARY HIGH COMMAND AND SECURITY OFFICIALS, AND IS PREPARING COUNTER-MEASURES TO DEAL WITH SITUATION. END SUMMARY.\n\n312240Z\n\nAS REPORTED IN REFTLS, POLITICAL TENSIONS HAVE BEEN\n\nKEPT AT RELATIVELY HIGH LEVEL THROUGHOUT MAY BY SEPARATE ISSUES OF ECONOMIC AGREEMNTS WITH BRAZIL AND SUBSEQUENT DETERIORATION IN UNIVERSITY SITUATION. WITHIN PAST FEW DDAYS, EMBASSY HAS GATHERED NEW INFORMATION INDICATING THAT CURRENTS OF UNREST SYMBOLIZED BY THESE TWO ISSUES ARE NOW UNITING INTO BROADER ANTI-GOVERNMENT CAMPAIGN OF AGITUATION. ONE KEY ELE- MENT IN NEW SITUATION IS INCREASED ACTIVITY OF GROUP OF YOUNGER MILITARY OFFICERS, AT JUNIOR AND MIDDLE GRADES, WHO HAVE OFTEN BEEN REPORTED IN PAST TO ENGAGE IN LOW-LEVEL PLOTTING AGAINST GOVERNMENT. THESE OFFICERS, WHO INCREASINGLY APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN MAJOR PROVOCATIVE ELEMENT IN JANUARY DISTURBANCES IN COCHABAMBA, ARE DEEPLY CONCERNED OVER ISSUE OF BOLIVIA’S ECONOMIC “DEPENDENCY” ON BRAZIL AND MAY ALSO HAVE HELPED TO STIMULATE RECENT STUDENT DISORDERS IN LA PAZ AND SUCRE. ON EDUCATIONAL SCENE, ALL UNIVERSITY AND SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENTS ARE CURRENTLY ON STRIKE IN LA PAZ AND SUCRE. IN LATTER CITY, FOUR DAYS OF DEMONSTRATIONS HAVE LEFT ESTIMATED THIRTY STUDENTS AND TEN POLICE INJURED: REPORTS OF MORE SERIOUS CASUALTIES AMONG STUDENTS CANNOT BE CONFIRMED AT PRESENT. SUPPORT BY ALL AMJOR LABOR UNIONS FOR STUDENT’ DEMANDS IN PAST TWO WEEKS ALSO CREATES IMPRESSION OF GROWING ALLIANCE OF OPPORTUNITY BETWEEN VARIOUS OPPOSITION FORCES. IN FACE OF THIS SITUATION, FSB DECLARED NATIONAL MOBILIZATION OF PARTY MEMBERS “IN ARMS” ON MAY 30, IN ORDER TO OPPOSE ALLEGED SUBVERSIVE MOVMENT AIMED AT GOVERNMENT’S OVERTHROW. ON SAME DAY, FOUR MEMBERS OF FALANGE AND EX-COMMANDER OF MILITARY AVIATION SCHOOL COL HUGO MUNOZ DEPARTED SANTA CRUZ INTO “VOLUNTARY EXILE” ALL FIVE MEN HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED IN PAST WITH PRO-VALVERDE FORCES IN SANTNTA CRUZ AREA. FINALLY, SPOKESMEN FOR PDC-PRA- MNRI ALLIANCE CONTINUE TO ISSUE SHRILL COMMUNIQUES DENOUNCING BANZER GOVERMENT FOR HAVING “ERASED LAST VESTIGES OF DEMONCRACY IN BOLIVIA” BY ITS RECENT ARRESTS OF STUDENT LEADERS, LABOR OFFICIALS AND POLITICIANS.\n\nGOVERNMENT CONCERN OVER THIS GROWING THREAT TO POLITICAL STABILITY WAS EVIDENCED DRAMATICALLY ON MAY 29 WHEN PRESIDENT BANZER CUT SHORT VISIT TO COCHABAMBA IN ORDER TO RETURN TO LA PAZ FOR POST-MIDNIGHT CONFERENCE WITH MILITARY HIGH COMMAND. SUBSEQUENTLY, BANZER CONFERRED WITH MILITARY AND SECURITY OFFICIALS THROUGHOUT DAY OF MAY 30 BEFORE DEPARTING THAT EVENING\n\n312240Z\nFOR SANTA CRUZ. MINISTER OF INTERIOR HAS BEEN HIGHLY ACTIVE IN PAST FEW DAYS, VISITING SCENE OF DISTURBANCES IN SUCRE AND ISSUING FREQUENT DENOUNCEMENTS OF “SUBVERSIVE”ACTIVITY IN STUDENT AND LABOR CIRCLES. VARIOUS GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS HAVE CANCELLED THEIR PLANS TO TRAVEL OUTSIDE BOLIVIA OR TO INTERIOR OF COUNTRY AS GOB PREPARES MEASURES TO DEAL WITH PRESENT SITUATION.\n\nCOMMENT. RELIABLE EMBASSY SOURCE INFORMS US THAT\n\nBANZER RETURN FROM COCHABAMBA WAS DUE TO DISCOVERY OF ASSASSINATION PLOT THERE, WHICH WAS TO SET OFF COUP LED BY ONE OR TWO REGIMENTS, UNION STRIKES AND STUDENT DEMON- STRATIONS. BANZER TOLD MILITARY LEADERS HE COULD UNDERSTAND LEFT OR OPPOSITION PARTIES TRYING TO KILL HIM, BUT NOT MEMBERS OF HIS OWN MILITARY INSTITUTION. SUBSEQUENTLY HE TOLD THIS IN RESERVE TO FALANGE TOP LEADERSHIP AND DECISION WAS TAKEN TO HAVE FALANGE COME OUT IN MOBILIZATION IN SUPPORT OF BANZER, HOLDING MILITARY IN RESERVE FOR LATER CONTINGENCIES. MNR NOT TRUSTED BECAUSE OF ALLEGED LINKS TO COUP PLOT OF SILES, OTHER EXILED MNR LEADERS: GOB FEARED SOME IN-COUNTRY MNR LEADERS MIGHT HAVE LINKS TO COUP PLOTTERS.\n\nIN PLOT ARE SOME MILITARY OFFICEFS (UNKNOWN) WHOM IDENTITY BANZER HIMSELF IS CURRENTLY HOPING TO DETERMINE. SUSPICIONS EXIST THAT SOMEONE AT HIGH LEVEL IS PATRONIZING THESE OFFICERS, SINCE IN BOLIVIA NO ONE ATTEMPTS A COUP UNLESS THERE IS SOMEONE IN THE GOVERNMENT TO “HOLD OPEN THE DOOR” FOR HIM. SOME FEELING THAT KEY SENIOR OFFICER RESPONSIBLE MAY BE MENDIETA OR GENERAL ALVAREZ. SOME PROPAGANDA SHEETS REPORTEDLY CIRCULATING IN ARMED FORCES CALLING FOR JUNIOR OFFICERS TO ASSUME COMMAND. ALSO, THERE IS SUSPICION AMONG LOYAL ARMY OFFICERS THAT NUMBER OF OFFICERS IN POLICE FORCES, JUST BELOW SENIOR LEVEL, ARE INVOLVED IN THE COUP PLOTTING. EVIDENCE OF PRIOR ORGANIZATION OUTSIDE BACKING ALO FOUND AT SUCRE, WHERE SOME OF STUDENTS THROWING MOLOTOV COCKTAILS AT POLICE WERE FOUND TOHAVE INSTRUCTION SHEETS ON HOW TO MAKE THESE, HOW TO FORM BARRICADES, PROTECT SELVES AGAINST TEAR GAS, ET.\nBANZER ASKED THAT FSB, OTHER CIVILIAN SUPPORTERS OF REGIME GIVE HIM”THREE OR FOUR DAYS” TO DISCOVER WHO IS INVOLVED IN PLANNED COUP. CARLOS VALVERDE ALSO IS REPORTED TO BE\n\n312240Z\nIN COUNTRY, AND IS VERY LIKELY INVOLVED IN WHATEVER IS GOING ON.

In his press conference remarks, Guzman said that he had also presented to Secretary Kissinger the Bolivian case for special preference for loans because of its state of underdevelopment compounded by its lack of a sea-coast. He said too that he asked the secretary for special “non-reimbursable” financing for the substitution of coca production. These remarks, he said, were well received by the U.S. Secretary of State, although no formal response given.\nThe minister sought with Secretary Kissinger. He stated that Latin Americans, especially Bolivians, believe they will receive answers to propositions put to the secretary at the April OAS meeting in Atlanta, if not before.\nAmple press coverage was given to the minister’s press conference. U.S. assistance was featured as if it were assured. An editorial in Diario the following day credits the U.S. with its generosity in coming to Bolivia’s assistance with reconstruction loans.\nUnless Department instructs us to the contrary, we shall attempt to steer any requests to us for financial aid for flood damage reconstruction toward IBRD and IDB as well as to AID. We also believe the GOB should be encouraged to present its needs in this regard to the CIAP in the country review scheduled for next month. The request for a crop substitution credit will be reviewed with Perry Shankle, ARA Bureau Narcotics Advisor, now in La Paz.\nWe shall be most appreciative for any guidance Dept can give us.

Under Bolivia’s current election laws (which virtually everyone wants to change before the next election in May 1980) this election took place in the new Bolivian Congress, since neither of the major candidates, Victor Paz and Hernan Siles, received a majority of the first-round popular vote. After five congressional ballots and a deadlock in which neither Paz nor Siles could achieve the required majority in the indirect election in the Congress, that body, under a provision of the Constitution, chose Senate President Walter Guevara Arze as president for a period of one year pending new elections under a revised electoral law.\nFrom the standpoint of the US objective of successful transition to constitutional, civilian rule, how should we evaluate the second-round election in the Congress of Senate President Walter Guevara Arze rather than either of the major candidates in the popular vote? On first blush, one might judge this indirect result of Bolivia’s already indirect election to be a flawed one with less than clear legitimacy. Our judgment is the opposite: that a Guevara transitional government, given the indecisive result of the popular vote, is probably the best outcome possible. End summary.\nThe indecisive popular vote and the current Constitution’s provision for subsequent indirect election in the new Congress sent both Paz and Siles into that Congress with bitterly competing and in the end irreconcilable claims to the presidency. Paz’ claim was based on his larger congressional delegation, resulting from the present law’s over-representation of regional units. Siles’ claim was based on his narrow margin in the popular vote and the possibility that this margin might have been larger if the National Electoral Court had done its job better. These disparate claims and the unexpectedly strong party discipline in upholding them raised the prospect of Paz (or remotely Siles) eeking out the presidency without a congressional majority or, perhaps more important, without a modicum of opposition tolerance for his government. The stark regional split of the popular vote, La Paz rejecting Victor Paz Estensoro and the eastern lowlands Siles, could have meant bitter regional resistance in either case. In these circumstances, the risk of fratricidal opposition clouded the prospects for survival of that government and of the democratization process. A Victor Paz government based only on his own MNR-Historico could have faced early-on the bitter choice of collapse or repression as its means of survival. To some extent it was a sincere fear of the latter possibility that kept any of the small political groups that could have made a Victor Paz government from doing so.\nIronically, a Guevara government may be stronger and more durable. A Guevara government, emerging from a congressional consensus and with broad commitment to completion of its transitional task, has a fighting chance of surviving and meeting its recognized priorities of economic stabilization and preparation of a better political and legal base for the next election. The Guevara government could also form a bridge over Bolivia’s stark generation gap in civilian political leadership. Paz and Siles are both aged and divisive figures from Bolivia’s colorful but bitter past. Neither has inspired a broad following among the generation that now dominates the electorate, as the voting result clearly showed. While in 1978 and 1979 these two warhorses necessarily filled the void in political leadership caused by the rapid collapse of military rule, the recent campaign may have been the last for both (although in the case of Siles this depends more on his frail health than his choice). The dispersion of the popular vote and the congressional stand-off can be read as a low-confidence vote in all three ex-presidents (Paz, Siles and Banzer) and a desire for new faces from a new generation. In a transitional governing period some of these new faces will have a chance to show.\nGuevara the man is an excellent choice for the job handed him, as the Senate undoubtedly had in mind when electing him President of the Senate, since the possibility of his assumption of the presidency was recognized at that time. He is an intelligent politician and serene, dignified statesman. His impressive and even-handed chairmanship of the first two days of the combined Senate/Chamber body, carried on national television, set him a good cut above his fellow politicians. He is more rational and pragmatic than the emotional, intransigent character that has set the tone of Bolivian politics up to now. While he was Interior Minister under Siles, Guevara was associated with part of Bolivia’s violent past, but he has somehow managed to maintain an aura of the non-divisive father figure. He and his PRA party were coldly cut down to size by Victor Paz in the last 9 months. In general Guevara is not a strong political infighter, but he could be a good healer. He was picked for this role, probably with some sense that his small party base, together with his personality and skills, while impressive, do not readily lend themselves to his catching the bug of power to the extent of mounting a successful effort to succeed himself in 1980.\nThere are weaknesses in the Guevara solution as well. The badly-drafted Bolivian Constitution, which simply does not foresee the possibility of deadlock in which the Congress found itself, can be interpreted otherwise than it was in the resolution electing Guevara president. Opponents could challenge the legal basis for Guevara’s interim presidency. Also, the UDP, while supporting Guevara’s election has left itself free to assume the role of full opposition to his governing program, including economic stabilization measures.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1979LAPAZ06712\nDate: August 07, 1979\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 jan 1960\nConcepts: CONSTITUTIONAL LAW, INTERIM GOVERNMENT, PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS, DISPUTED ELECTIONS, PERSONNEL"

Congressman and Minister then discussed level to which crude oil prices might eventually fall on basis of competing fuel sources such as shale oil.\nMinister said GOB monthly price level is minimum that now applies to all Bolivian crude exports as GOB is now free of all restraining contracts. He observed that Santa Cruz Department royalties will now be on order of US$ 1.5 million per month and that GOB was now telling Santa Cruz Public Works Committee that it will have to finance more of infrastructure projects in Santa Cruz from its own resources rather than looking to GOB for support.\nMinister said hydropower extremely important in Bolivia and that there are many possibilities for expanding hydropower capacity. Said major project is multipurpose Bala Dam and that it would be undertaken soon by joint corporation made up of ENDE (state owned power company serving region extending from Oruro to Cochabamba to Santa Cruz), COFADENA (Armed Forces Development Corporation) and CORDEPAZ (La Paz Department Development Corporation).\nIn response to question Capriles stated that distribution under new AID rural electrification would be taken care of by government. He stated that Bolivian Power Company wishes to sell out unprofitable operation here but government not repeat not in position to take over assets at this time. Nonetheless, he said that government monopoly over power production increasingly the pattern in Latin America.\nIn earlier conversation Bolivian Power’s local manager told Congressman that government had ignored company’s offer three years ago to sell out. Said that more recently company offered to keep distribution function which it most capable of handling and to sell production side of business to CORDEPAZ. He reported feasibility study by CORDEPAZ due to be finished this week.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1974LAPAZ00293\nDate: January 16, 1974\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 JAN 1960\nConcepts: PETROLEUM, MINISTERIAL MEETINGS, EMBARGOES, PRICE TRENDS, HYDROELECTRIC POWER PLANTS"

PRESIDENT BANZER HAS MADE THIS INTEREST KNOWN TO ME EXPLICITY. THE BOLIVIAN AIR FORCE HAS BEEN IN TOUCH WITH OUR MILITARY MISSION ABOUT THESE AIRCRAFT. WHILE THE BOLIVIAN AUTHORITIES WOULD PREFER NEW UNITS, THEY WOULD BE SATISFIED WITH PROMPT DELIVERY OF USED EQUIPMENT PROVIDED, NATURALLY, IT IS IN SERVICEABLE CONDITION. I HAVE JUST RECEIVED PRICE AND AVAILABILITY DATA FOR NEW C-130 AIRCRAFT THROUGH U.S. MILITARY CHANNELS INDICATING A COMPLETE PRICE PER UNIT OF ABOUT $8 MILLION AND A DELIVERY TIME OF 1977. WE SHALL APPRRIATELY INFORM THE BOLIVIAN AUTHORITIES OF THIS INFORMA- TION WHICH WILL DISAPPOINT THEM AND ADDITIONALLY HEIGHTEN THEIR INTEREST IN USED C-130 AIRCRAFT.\nI WOULD THEREFORE APPRECIATE, ON AN URGENT BASIS, AN AGGRESSIVE EFFORT BY STATE AND DEFENSE TO LOCATE TWO OR AT LEAST ONE USED C-130 AIRCRAFT WHICH CAN BE OFFERED FOR PURCHASE BY BOLIVIA AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. THE C-130 IS AN IDEAL TRANSPORT\n\n201513Z\nAIRCRAFT FOR THIS COUNTRY FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND CIVIC\nACTION PURPOSES. THIS HAS BEEN AMPLY PROVEN IN THE PAST THROUGH EFFECTIVE AIRLIFTS PROVIDED BOLIVIA BY C-130 AIRCRAFT FROM SOUTHERN COMMAND. C-130’S HAVE MADE POSITIVE CONTRIBUTIONS HERE IN AIRLIFTING CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE EQUIPMENT FROM ONE AREA OF THE COUNTRY TO ANOTHER THROUGH WHICH NO OTHER TRANSPORTATION MEANS AVAILABLE. DURING EMERGENCIES SUCH AS ANNUAL FLOODING, WHEN RAIL AND ROAD TRANSPORT BROKEN, C-130 AIRLIFTS HAVE MOVED FOOD FROM STORAGE LOCATIONS TO POPULATION CENTERS. BOLIVIA HAS, AS IS WELL KNOWN, A WEAK TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM AT BEST, OVER SOME OF THE MOST DIFFICULT TERRAIN IN THE WORLD. THE ADDITIONAL TRANSPORTATION CAPABILITY PROVIDED BOLIVIA BY THE POSSESSION OF C-130 AIRCRAFT WOULD BE EXTREMELY BENEFICIAL.\n\nI URGE PROMPT ACTION TO MEET BOLIVIA’S DESIRES TO PURCHASE C-130 AIRCRAFT FOR POLITICAL REASONS AS WELL. THE BENEFITS TO THE U.S. FROM THE PRESENCE IN BOLIVIA OF A U.S. MANUFACTURED C-130 AIRCRAFT PROVING ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND CIVIC ACTION ASSISTANCE WOULD BE GREAT. I BELIEVE THAT AT THE COST OF SOME INTERNAL ADMINISTRATIVE EFFORT, WE CAN DERIVE SUBSTANTIAL POLITICAL GAINS HERE.\nIF USED C-130’S ARE BECOMING AVAILABLE FROM U.S. AIR NATIONAL GUARD, I RECOMMEND ALLOCATION OF AT LEAST ONE FOR BOLIVIA. IF THIS SOURCE IS NOT VIABLE, THEN I SINCERELY HOPE MAXIMUM EFFORT WILL BE MADE TO LOCATE ANOTHER.\nPLEASE ADVISE.

THE GOB AND HE, PERSONALLY, ARE DEEPLY GRATEFUL TO THE USG FOR CONTINUING U.S. ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE, WITH SPECIAL REGARD FOR THOSE LOANS MADE FOR EMERGENCY ACTIVITIES SHORTLY AFTER HE ASSUMED POWER. THE GOVERNMENT WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO HAVE THE U.S. CONSIDER AN ADDITIONAL PADES LOAN SINCE IT HAS PROVEN TO BE AN EFFECTIVE DEVELOPMENT TOOL AND A POSITIVE FACTOR FOR STABILITY IN THE COUNTRY.\nB. THE GOVERNMENT IS SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING OUR RECENT OFFER OF $4 MILLION FMS CREDIT AND WILL COMMUNICATE ITS RESPONSE PROMPTLY. THE GOB MAY WISH TO USE THE LINE OF CREDIT FOR TRANSPORT AIRCRAFT, HEAVY CONSTRUCTION MACHINERY, AND OTHER HARDWARE WHICH MIGHT HAVE A PRODUCTIVE PURPOSE.\nC. THE GOVERNMENT IS PLEASED TO LEARN THAT A TEAM COMPOSED OF\n241827Z\nIDB, IBRD, AND AID TECHNICANS WILL SOON ARRIVE IN BOLIVIA TO ASSESS\nFLOOD DAMAGE. BASED ON THAT ASSESSMENT, THE PRESIDENT SAID, HE HOPED THAT PROJECTS MIGHT BE DEVELOPED TO PREVENT FUTURE FLOODING AND TO RELOCATE AND HOUSE REFUGEES\nD. THE PRESIDENT WAS PLEASED TO LEARN THAT USG TECHNICIANS WILL ARRIVE SOON TO STUDY THE POSSIBILITIES OF SUBSTITUTION OF ALTERNATIVE CROPS FOR COCA. HE SUGGESTED EXAMINATION OF POSSIBLE COURSES OF ACTION\nSUCH AS PURCHASE OF COCA LEAF PRODUCTION AND ITS DESTRUCTION, OR INCENTIVE PAYMENTS DIRECTLY TO FARMERS TO PRODUCE OTHER COMMODITIES.\nE. PRESIDENT EXPRESSED HIS CONTINUED INTEREST IN PROMPT DELIVERY OF MILITARY EQUIPMENT FOR THE TIPOS IN ACCORDANCE WITH UNDERSTANDINGS REACHED WITH US. THE AMBASSADOR DESCRIBED THE CURRENT DELIVERY FORECASTS AND REPORTED ON THE ARRIVAL OF SIGNIFICANT MILITARY ITEMS IN RECENT WEEKS AND WITHIN THE COMING MONTH. PRESIDENT SEEMED PLEASED BUT REPEATED HIS FIRM DESIRE THAT THE TIPOS BE BROUGHT UP TO STRENGTH AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE TO RAISE THE MORALE OF THE TROOPS AND TO CREATE A DISSUASIVE FORCE TO INHIBIT THE OUTBREAK OF INTERNAL DISORDER.\n\nCOUNTRY DIRECTOR KARKASHIAN EXPLAINED THE OPERATIONS OF AN FMS CREDIT, NOTED THE INCREASING DIFFICULTIES OF ACQUIRING MAP GRANT AID AND POINTED OUT THE DESIRABILITY OF BOLIVIA’S UTILIZATION OF FMS CREDIT. KARKASHIAN EXPRESSED THE APPRECIATION OF WASHINGTON AUTHORITIES FOR BOLIVIA’S CONTINUED EFFECTIVE COOPERATION IN COMBATTING DRUG TRAFFICKING. WHILE STATING THE U.S. POLICY OF CONTINUED SUPPORT AND ASSISTANCE FOR THE BOLIVIAN GOVERNMENT, HE CAREFULLY AVOIDED SPECIFIC COMMITMENTS FOR LOANS FOR CROP SUBSTITUTION, NEW PADES OPEATIONS, AND FOR RECONSTRUCTION.\nIN THE DISCUSSION OF FMS CREDIT, PRESIDENT BANZER SAID THAT IT WAS HIS HOPE THAT COFADENA WOULD BECOME AN EFFECTIVE INSTRUMENT FOR ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT. HE SAID IT SHOULD CONCENTRATE ITS ACTIVITIES RATHER THAN CONTINUING AS AT PRESENT TO AGGRESSIVELY ENTER A WIDE RANGE OF ACTIVITIES. HE EXPRESSED HIS HOPE THAT EXTERNAL CREDITS MIGHT FACILITATE CONFADENA ACQUISITION OF PRODUCTIVE\n\n241827Z\nEQUIPMENT AND THAT ITS FUTURE PROFITS COULD THEN BE TURNED TO BENEFIT THE LOT OF THE COMMON SOLDIER WITH BETTER HOUSING AND MEDICAL CARE. IN THIS WAY HE HOPES TO REDUCE THE DEMANDS ON THE TREASURY FOR MILITARY EXPENDITURES AND BURDENING THE NATION WITH CREDITS FOR NON-PRODUCTIVE MILITARY EQUIPMENT.\n\nPRESIDENT BANZER TOLD KARKASHIAN THAT HE REGRETTED HAVING TO POST- PONE THE STATE VISIT TO THE U.S. SCHEDULED FOR LAST FALL, BUT DOMESTIC POLITICAL FACTORS ARISING FROM ECONOMIC MEASURES PRECLUDED HIS DEPARTING THE COUNTRY. THE PRESIDENT SAID HE HOPED THAT HE BE ABLE TO MAKE THE TRIP SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE AT PRESIDENT NIXON’S AND HIS MUTUAL CONVENIENCE. KARKASHIAN RESPONDED THAT THIS WAS ALSO THE DESIRE OF THE USG AS SET FORTH IN PRESIDENT NIXON’S LETTER TO PRESIDENT BANZER.

I NOTED THAT BOLIVIA WAS NOT BEING SINGLED OUT BUT THAT ALL AID RECIPIENT GOVERNMENTS WERE BEING INFORMED OF THIS PROVISION. I INDICATED THAT SECTION 32 DESERVES SERIOUS CONSIDERATION BY THE GOB.\nFOREIGN MINISTER GUZMAN READ SPANISH TEXT I PROVIDED HIM OF SECTION 32 AND INDICATED HIS GENERAL APPROVAL OF THE CONGRESSIONAL SENTIMENT. HE NOTED DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GOVERNMENT TAKING ACTION AGAINST CITIZENS FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES AND CITIZENS ENGAGING IN ILLEGAL ACTS AGAINST GOVERNMENT REQUIREING PROTECTIVE MEASURES BY AUTHORITIES. HE NOTED THAT NEWLY INSTALLED MILITARY CABINET SHOULD IMPROVE\n\n192224Z\nPOLITICAL STABILITY IN BOLIVIA AND THAT EPISODES SUCH AS\nTHE RECENT ABORTIVE PLOT OF JUNE 4/5 SHOULD NOT RECUR. THEREFORE, GOB NEED NOT RESORT TO REPRESSIVE MEASURES BECAUSE POLITICAL TRAQUILITY SHOULD BE INSURED NOW. FOREIGN MINISTER SAID FOREGOING REMARKS SHOULD BE TREATTED AS HIS IMMEDIATE PERSONAL REACTION TO READING TEXT OF SECTION 32 OF FAA. HE SAID HE WOULD HAVE EARLY OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH PRESIDENT AND WOULD REVIEW WITH HIM THE CONGRESSIONAL CONCERNS SO AS TO GIVE ME AN OFFICIAL GOB POSITION.

In July 1978 we completed our investigation and sent our report to USDOC and SECSTATE. Our efforts have continued but with virtually no new information. We have found it extremely difficult to obtain information about this company.\nThe Anglo-Bolivian Land and Cattle Company is the international sales department of Varangian Investments Ltda. We do not know in which country Varangian Investments is registered. According to a document sent to the Santa Cruz, Bolivia Prefect, Varangian Investments was founded about 1964 and has operated throughout Central America and the Caribbean, where the firm has engaged in agriculture, cattle, and real estate activities. Varangian Investments appears to be related to the Inter-American Finance Corp. in London. Amembassy London has been unsuccessful in its efforts to contact this firm for additional information (REFTEL E). According to our information, neither Varangian Investments nor the Anglo-Bolivian Land and Cattle Company are registered in Bolivia. These two companies apparently formed three Bolivian companies, Santa Teresita Ltda., El Parnaso Ltda., and Los Milagros Ltda., to acquire and develop land near Santa Cruz.\nMr. James M. Rodengen was and may still be the general manager of Santa Teresita Ltda., the only active one of the three Bolivian companies associated with ABLC. Mr. Rodengen worked for seven years as the Varangian Investments director of sales for the Central America region before Varangian Investments transferred him to Santa Cruz. His address was the following: Casilla 3746, Santa Cruz, Bolivia; Phone: 30022 - Telex: CABINA PUBLICA BX 7600 ANBOL.\nMr. Alan D. Hutchinson is an attorney who is the managing director of the Anglo-Bolivian Land and Cattle Co. He is also director of the Inter-American Finance Corp. Although apparently residing in London, he travels to Santa Cruz frequently.\nThrough Santa Teresita Ltda., the Anglo-Bolivian Land and Cattle Co. purchased three parcels of contiguous land totaling 11,000 hectares near Santa Cruz during the last quarter of 1977. Supposedly, each piece of property that is for sale is well-marked and has an access road. Sales prices are about US$ 34 to US$ 40 per hectare. These prices are considered to be above the area’s current market prices. Property values are not expected to reach current sales prices for two or three more years. Therefore, the firm’s offer appears to be a highly speculative one. Anglo-Bolivian Land and Cattle Co. guarantees clear title to the property. Money may be placed in escrow until title is received.\nThe following mail addresses for Anglo-Bolivian Land and Cattle Co. have appeared in the sales literature which we have seen: A. Box 58, 15 Central St., Woodstock, Vermont 05091 B. Barclays Bank Building, P.O. Box 265, Grand Cayman, British West Indies C. Schiphol Airport East, P.O. Box 7766, Amsterdam, The Netherlands USDOC found the Vermont mail is merely forwarded to Mr. Hutchinson in London (REFTEL B). Also, AmConsul Amsterdam reports that the Amsterdam P.O. Box is used only by an air transport firm (REFTEL D).\nOn December 26, 1978 the Bank of America branch in Santa Cruz told US that ABLC is not a client but that they are supported financially by Inter-American Finance Company domiciled in Grand Cayman and that any financial figures on both companies could be available through the Barclay’s International Bank in the same city.\nThe Bolivian Consejo Nacional de Reforma Agraria makes no guarantee as to the soundness of this investment and recommends that persons interested in purchasing lots visit the property first to verify the company’s assertions and to find out the real cost of the property.\nAn Undersecretary in the Ministry of Agriculture told US in February 1979 that the GOB had virtually no information about ABLC. He suggested that the new tracts of land now being sold by ABLC are public lands. (The initial three tracts were sold out). He was going to investigate this matter and report to US, but so far, he has no new information.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1979LAPAZ06550\nDate: August 01, 1979\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 jan 1960\nConcepts: LAND, CATTLE"

After considerable consultation with appropriate country team members we do not feel that having a seminar in Lima would benefit mission objectives in La Paz. Our representative to Andean PAO meeting did not understand simultaneous seminars to mean sending participants to other country.\nNormal spin-off benefits from seminars include: A. Strengthening contacts with key individual through close proximity over a period of time. B. Being able to present points to further local CASP and CPM courses of action. C. Using local media to convey to a larger audience the key points brought out during the discussions. D. Using the STAG’s as entre to groups with whom one would not ordinarily have easy access.\nNone of these benefits would accrue to Bolivia if we participated in Peru’s seminar. Under the circumstances we prefer not to participate in the proposed Vogel, Pollack, Turpin seminar. Like Quito we feel our money could be better spect in a locally produced seminar later in the fiscal year. Are consulting WPTH Economic/Commercial Section on practical aspects to be covered and will submit details and STAG requests later.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1974LAPAZ00162\nDate: January 09, 1974\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 JAN 1960\nConcepts: PERSONNEL TRAINING, DRUG CONTROL, MEETINGS"

The delegation did not purchase any Bolivian cotton but indicated interest in future purchases. Also, the delegation did invite several members from the Bolivian Cotton Producers Association, ADEPA, to visit the PRC in the immediate future.\nComment: Recent, severe flooding had an adverse impact on Bolivia’s 1979 cotton crop. Because of the resulting low yields, the CHINATEX delegation probably decided to postpone purchases of Bolivian cotton.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1979LAPAZ03861\nDate: May 03, 1979\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 jan 1960\nConcepts: COTTON, VISITS, TRADE AGREEMENTS"
