    "text": "Date:\n          July 08, 1979\n        \n                    \n          From:\n          AmEmbassy La Paz\n        \n                    \n          To:\n          SecState WashDC Niact Immediate 7151\n        \n                    \n          Info:\n          Oct-01 Ads-00 Sso-00 /026 W ——————103473 082010z /62 O 081931z Jul 79\n        \n                    \n          Subject:\n          Proposed Reply Of President Carter To President Padilla’s Letter Of July 6\n        \n                    \n          TAGS:\n          PFORN, BL\n        \n                    \n          Ref:\n          A) LA PAZ 5832, B) LA PAZ 5831\n        \n            \n    \n    \n  \n\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE TELEGRAM\nUNCLASSIFIED\n\nSummary: I recommend that we use the opportunity of Padilla’s letter to the President to reply promptly and responsively in a way that would strengthen Padilla’s hand in getting his generals to accept the electoral result. Since the mood in the armed forces is somewhat better than we had anticipated, our reply can be less heavy than we earlier considered. The main point should be to indicate to the Bolivian military that democratic government will be a significant boost to Bolivia’s chances to realize its economic, political and diplomatic objectives. Padilla wants to see me Tuesday night, but I could probably put this off to Wednesday night. Hopefully by then I would be able personally to deliver the President’s reply to Padilla.\nMy suggested draft reply (in paragraphs 4 to 9 below) presumes decisions and actions on two matters: a successful approach to Senator Hart to get him to delay reporting out a stockpile disposal bill until after the Senate’s August recess; and a decision on our delegation to the inauguration, which I hope can be headed by Mrs. Carter, if at all possible. The proposed commitment not to sell tin in 1979 is not really a separate policy decision, since if the Congressional authorization is delayed to September, the normal consultation process will delay sales until 1980 in any event.\nBegin suggested draft letter. Dear Mr. President. I have taken to heart your thoughtful letter of July 6, in which you raise your concerns regarding U.S. tin policy and its relationship to Bolivia’s return to constitutional, elected government. I appreciate your raising these concerns with me in the cordial and open manner that is a hallmark of U.S. - Bolivian relations.\nFirst of all, Mr. President, let me congratulate you and Bolivian armed forces for your stalwart leadership in returning your country to democratic rule–a venture which has captured the imagination and admiration of my country and Bolivia’s friends everywhere. The successful completion of this hopeful process with the August 6 inauguration will place Bolivia firmly among the democratic countries of our hemisphere and enhance Bolivia’s international standing and capacity to achieve its economic, political and diplomatic objectives.\nOn the matter of tin, let me assure you that the United States will manage any eventual disposals so as to safeguard against disruption of the tin market and the economic position of producers, including Bolivia. In response to your letter, the White House has contacted Senator Hart who, in recognition of Bolivia’s return to constitutional rule, has agreed to postpone Senate action on stockpile legislation until after the Senate’s August recess. This should assure that no dramatic news on tin occurs during the final stage of Bolivia’s efforts to complete the election process in your Congress. I can also assure you that no tin sales will take place in 1979, when Bolivia’s elected government is developing and implementing a program to stabilize the country’s economy. Any sales plans in 1980 will be developed on the basis of full consultation with Bolivia’s new, elected government, as well as with other producers, and will be designed to the best of our abilities to avoid depressing the export earnings Bolivia’s new government will need for its stabilization effort. You can also rest assured that my government will work through the international financial institutions and with Bolivia’s new government to help that government raise the financial support necessary to back a sound stabilization program.\nI am aware of your country’s plans to raise the issue of Bolivia’s aspiration for access to the sea at the OAS General Assembly meeting this October in La Paz. You know from my remarks to the OAS last year of my personal interest in this question. We will now be awaiting Bolivia’s definition of an approach to this issue with every desire to be supportive wherever we can.\nTo express as clearly as possible to the Bolivian people our goodwill and deep appreciation of the country’s orderly return to constitutional rule, I am asking my wife Rosalyn (alternate choice) to represent me at the inauguration of Bolivia’s new President on August 6.\nAs, Mr. President, approach the final stage of Bolivia’s return to constitutional rule, a process which you have so steadfastly overseen, let me wish Bolivia full success in this historic venture, and to you personally all the best in the future. End of suggested draft letter.\nThe President’s reply to Padilla would be most effective if I could have it in time to deliver personally by P.M. Wednesday July 11.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1979LAPAZ05838\nDate: July 08, 1979\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 20 Mar 2014\nConcepts: DEMOCRACY, POLICIES, TIN, DIPLOMATIC COMMUNICATIONS, ELECTIONS, STOCKPILE DISPOSAL, ACCESS TO PORTS"

After considerable consultation with appropriate country team members we do not feel that having a seminar in Lima would benefit mission objectives in La Paz. Our representative to Andean PAO meeting did not understand simultaneous seminars to mean sending participants to other country.\nNormal spin-off benefits from seminars include: A. Strengthening contacts with key individual through close proximity over a period of time. B. Being able to present points to further local CASP and CPM courses of action. C. Using local media to convey to a larger audience the key points brought out during the discussions. D. Using the STAG’s as entre to groups with whom one would not ordinarily have easy access.\nNone of these benefits would accrue to Bolivia if we participated in Peru’s seminar. Under the circumstances we prefer not to participate in the proposed Vogel, Pollack, Turpin seminar. Like Quito we feel our money could be better spect in a locally produced seminar later in the fiscal year. Are consulting WPTH Economic/Commercial Section on practical aspects to be covered and will submit details and STAG requests later.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1974LAPAZ00162\nDate: January 09, 1974\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 JAN 1960\nConcepts: PERSONNEL TRAINING, DRUG CONTROL, MEETINGS"

Summary\nSome will say that the ghastly orgy of the Bolivian Right in the last 5 days was an inevitable, cathartic phase of Bolivia’s difficult course to civilian democracy. I had hoped it was not and still feel it could have been avoided if the civilian parties, backed by the decent–and then dominant–sector of the military, had come to a coalition agreement with President Walter Guevara even 48 hours earlier. Whether an unavoidable relapse set in or a very near rescue operation fell short by a hair, the scars of the bloody November eruption are clear and will be long lasting. End Summary.\n\n\n2. The Radical Right has had its Witches’ Sabbath\nIn the upside-down world of its own nightmares. For 5 days black has been white, repression has been deliverance, unarmed workers and innocent bystanders have been Trotskyite terrorists and phantom Cuban cadres. And the frightened recruits egged on by the officers of the paranoic Right really showed them. The phantoms were mowed down by the dozens to save Bolivia from the anarchy and chaos of the “tyrant” Walter Guevara–a quiet, fatherly intellectual who in fact presided over a peaceful and open Bolivian society in which no one was hurt and most people felt good about Bolivia again.\nBut the Right knew better, only they–the totem, self appointed savior Alberto Natusch, the psychotic Carlos Mena (Interior Minister) and the frustrated knights without dragons like Doria Medina (Commander of the spearhead armoured unit)–could see the real demons that hid beneath this placid surface.\n\n\n3. The Warning from Military Leaders\nThe good men who led the Bolivian Armed Forces until November 1, Generals David Padilla and Ramon Azero in particular, told these glassy eyed zealots that they were wrong and that the real Bolivia was otherwise. We did as well, repeatedly over the last 6 months. They were told again, within days of the November 1 coup that:\n\nThe Bolivian people wanted civilian democracy and would not stand idly by while some colonels told them they could not have it;\nThe labor unions would try to shut this country down before acquiescing in a military takeover;\nOnly repression could keep one of these colonels on top of an unwilling country;\nIn the futile effort to sustain such a repressive regime the unity and reputation of the Bolivian Armed Forces would be destroyed and Bolivia’s international image stained;\nIn the end the decent military would not stomach the necessary amount of repression.\n\nMost of these consequences have already been incurred while the last remains perilously suspended. But somehow the true believers would not take it from us nor their own commanders.\n\n\n4. Civilian Casualties and Resistance\nMost of the deaths in the last 5 days, to our knowledge, have been unarmed civilians gunned down by the military with automatic weapons. Yet the civilians have come back each day to mark their protest and hurl their ire. Threats of shooting and summary firing have not got them back to their jobs. Neither destruction by gun fire and sacking of the labor confederation headquarters nor deadly fire into crowds of militants gathered before it have broken the general strike. So far the Natusch regime’s appallingly indiscriminate firing at civilians has had the opposite of the intended effect. Resistance of the militants has been steeled and the most common people are afraid to enter the inner city to take up their jobs.\n\n\n5. Negotiations\nNegotiations between Natusch and the Congress continue. But in the end no compromise between civilian democracy and the military right of Natusch is possible: they are incompatible forces. The fanatics around Natusch, particularly Mena, keep telling him he must hang on or perish, and they are right. If Natusch accepts a graceful out of almost any kind, he and his sort, given the killing they have caused, will be swept by a counteraction out of the country if not out of this world. There may, therefore, be no graceful out for Natusch and his right-wing band of officers. If he is deposed, it is more likely to come from within the military than from negotiations with the Congress. There remains the fear that these negotiations are not in good faith and are only part of Natusch’s efforts to hold off military pressures to unseat him. Yet so far the focal point for a military counter move has not appeared.\n\n\n6. Reaction of “Good Officers”\nThe good officers are appalled and in tears of mixed rage and sorrow over the killing of civilians and degradation of the military as a political and social force in Bolivia. Generals Padilla and Azero, Colonel Caioja and others have lost their jobs and staked their lives over bold public calls to get the military out of the city, Natusch out of the palace and civilian democracy restored. But the bulk of the military is still watching and waiting.\n\n\n7. Damage Assessment\nWhether Natusch and his band leave tomorrow, next month or later, some awesome damage has already been done to Bolivia and its tortuous, but determined course to civilian, constitutional rule.\n\nThe fabric of military-civilian cooperation, so important to the democratic transition so far, has been rent by betrayal, blood and bitterness;\nThe fragile unity of the armed forces has been shattered by schisms of deep resentment and shame–and dissension in the armed forces has been the only serious threat to the peace that modern Bolivia has known;\nThe military has been disgraced and its ability to play a stabilizing, behind the scenes role damaged and perhaps destroyed;\nThe credibility in the eyes of the people of the moderate, civilian political parties has been shaken by the despicable instigating role in the coup of a handful of turncoats from the MNR and MNRI–Guillermo Bedregal, Jose Fellman Velarde, Edel Sandoval Moron and Abel Ayoroa Argandona.\n\n\n\n8. Conclusion\nThe possible positive effects in the hangover from the Walpurgisnacht of the Right are meager or nil. Just perhaps the arrogant, paranoic right of the military will be purged after the bloody binge on which they have misled their institution, perhaps civilian politics will throw out or indict the quislings who viewed a bloodbath as a small price for a government job. But neither one may happen and both together would not justify perhaps 100 dead and many more wounded, nor the lasting damage to an open society and Bolivians confidence in each other or themselves.\nBOEKER\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1979LAPAZ09512\nDate: 06 Nov 1979\nClassification: Confidential (EXDIS)\nDeclassified: 20 Mar 2014 (E.O.

After considerable consultation with appropriate country team members we do not feel that having a seminar in Lima would benefit mission objectives in La Paz. Our representative to Andean PAO meeting did not understand simultaneous seminars to mean sending participants to other country.\nNormal spin-off benefits from seminars include: A. Strengthening contacts with key individual through close proximity over a period of time. B. Being able to present points to further local CASP and CPM courses of action. C. Using local media to convey to a larger audience the key points brought out during the discussions. D. Using the STAG’s as entre to groups with whom one would not ordinarily have easy access.\nNone of these benefits would accrue to Bolivia if we participated in Peru’s seminar. Under the circumstances we prefer not to participate in the proposed Vogel, Pollack, Turpin seminar. Like Quito we feel our money could be better spect in a locally produced seminar later in the fiscal year. Are consulting WPTH Economic/Commercial Section on practical aspects to be covered and will submit details and STAG requests later.\n\n\n\nMessage Attributes\n\nDocument Number: 1974LAPAZ00162\nDate: January 09, 1974\nClassification: UNCLASSIFIED\nDeclassified: 01 JAN 1960\nConcepts: PERSONNEL TRAINING, DRUG CONTROL, MEETINGS"
