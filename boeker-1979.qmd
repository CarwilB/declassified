### 1. Summary

Some will say that the ghastly orgy of the Bolivian Right in the last 5 days was an inevitable, cathartic phase of Bolivia's difficult course to civilian democracy. I had hoped it was not and still feel it could have been avoided if the civilian parties, backed by the decent--and then dominant--sector of the military, had come to a coalition agreement with President Walter Guevara even 48 hours earlier. Whether an unavoidable relapse set in or a very near rescue operation fell short by a hair, the scars of the bloody November eruption are clear and will be long lasting. End Summary.

### 2. The Radical Right has had its Witches' Sabbath

In the upside-down world of its own nightmares. For 5 days black has been white, repression has been deliverance, unarmed workers and innocent bystanders have been Trotskyite terrorists and phantom Cuban cadres. And the frightened recruits egged on by the officers of the paranoic Right really showed them. The phantoms were mowed down by the dozens to save Bolivia from the anarchy and chaos of the "tyrant" Walter Guevara--a quiet, fatherly intellectual who in fact presided over a peaceful and open Bolivian society in which no one was hurt and most people felt good about Bolivia again.

But the Right knew better, only they--the totem, self appointed savior Alberto Natusch, the psychotic Carlos Mena (Interior Minister) and the frustrated knights without dragons like Doria Medina (Commander of the spearhead armoured unit)--could see the real demons that hid beneath this placid surface.

### 3. The Warning from Military Leaders

The good men who led the Bolivian Armed Forces until November 1, Generals David Padilla and Ramon Azero in particular, told these glassy eyed zealots that they were wrong and that the real Bolivia was otherwise. We did as well, repeatedly over the last 6 months. They were told again, within days of the November 1 coup that:

-   The Bolivian people wanted civilian democracy and would not stand idly by while some colonels told them they could not have it;
-   The labor unions would try to shut this country down before acquiescing in a military takeover;
-   Only repression could keep one of these colonels on top of an unwilling country;
-   In the futile effort to sustain such a repressive regime the unity and reputation of the Bolivian Armed Forces would be destroyed and Bolivia's international image stained;
-   In the end the decent military would not stomach the necessary amount of repression.

Most of these consequences have already been incurred while the last remains perilously suspended. But somehow the true believers would not take it from us nor their own commanders.

### 4. Civilian Casualties and Resistance

Most of the deaths in the last 5 days, to our knowledge, have been unarmed civilians gunned down by the military with automatic weapons. Yet the civilians have come back each day to mark their protest and hurl their ire. Threats of shooting and summary firing have not got them back to their jobs. Neither destruction by gun fire and sacking of the labor confederation headquarters nor deadly fire into crowds of militants gathered before it have broken the general strike. So far the Natusch regime's appallingly indiscriminate firing at civilians has had the opposite of the intended effect. Resistance of the militants has been steeled and the most common people are afraid to enter the inner city to take up their jobs.

### 5. Negotiations

Negotiations between Natusch and the Congress continue. But in the end no compromise between civilian democracy and the military right of Natusch is possible: they are incompatible forces. The fanatics around Natusch, particularly Mena, keep telling him he must hang on or perish, and they are right. If Natusch accepts a graceful out of almost any kind, he and his sort, given the killing they have caused, will be swept by a counteraction out of the country if not out of this world. There may, therefore, be no graceful out for Natusch and his right-wing band of officers. If he is deposed, it is more likely to come from within the military than from negotiations with the Congress. There remains the fear that these negotiations are not in good faith and are only part of Natusch's efforts to hold off military pressures to unseat him. Yet so far the focal point for a military counter move has not appeared.

### 6. Reaction of "Good Officers"

The good officers are appalled and in tears of mixed rage and sorrow over the killing of civilians and degradation of the military as a political and social force in Bolivia. Generals Padilla and Azero, Colonel Caioja and others have lost their jobs and staked their lives over bold public calls to get the military out of the city, Natusch out of the palace and civilian democracy restored. But the bulk of the military is still watching and waiting.

### 7. Damage Assessment

Whether Natusch and his band leave tomorrow, next month or later, some awesome damage has already been done to Bolivia and its tortuous, but determined course to civilian, constitutional rule.

1.  The fabric of military-civilian cooperation, so important to the democratic transition so far, has been rent by betrayal, blood and bitterness;
2.  The fragile unity of the armed forces has been shattered by schisms of deep resentment and shame--and dissension in the armed forces has been the only serious threat to the peace that modern Bolivia has known;
3.  The military has been disgraced and its ability to play a stabilizing, behind the scenes role damaged and perhaps destroyed;
4.  The credibility in the eyes of the people of the moderate, civilian political parties has been shaken by the despicable instigating role in the coup of a handful of turncoats from the MNR and MNRI--Guillermo Bedregal, Jose Fellman Velarde, Edel Sandoval Moron and Abel Ayoroa Argandona.

### 8. Conclusion

The possible positive effects in the hangover from the Walpurgisnacht of the Right are meager or nil. Just perhaps the arrogant, paranoic right of the military will be purged after the bloody binge on which they have misled their institution, perhaps civilian politics will throw out or indict the quislings who viewed a bloodbath as a small price for a government job. But neither one may happen and both together would not justify perhaps 100 dead and many more wounded, nor the lasting damage to an open society and Bolivians confidence in each other or themselves.
